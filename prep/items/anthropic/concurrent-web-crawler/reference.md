Two points are worth confirming before coding, since interviewers phrase this interface differently from one another: whether a link's scheme or port should affect whether it is in scope (here, no — only the hostname is compared, though scheme and port still make two URLs distinct for fetching purposes), and whether `get_urls` can fail (here, yes — a page whose fetch fails is still counted as crawled but yields no further links).

### Part 1

`normalize` strips the fragment; `same_host` compares `urlparse(...).hostname` strings. A plain breadth-first search keeps a `visited` set of normalised URLs, seeded with the start URL, and a FIFO queue of URLs still to fetch; every link a fetched page returns is queued the instant it is both in scope and new. `get_urls` raising is caught around the single call site, so one page's failure never stops the rest of the queue from draining.

```python
from typing import Protocol
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from collections import deque


class HtmlParser(Protocol):
    def get_urls(self, url: str) -> list[str]: ...


def normalize(url: str) -> str:
    return url.split("#", 1)[0]        # NOTE: split on the FIRST '#' -- a fragment cannot contain one itself


def same_host(url: str, host: str) -> bool:
    return urlparse(url).hostname == host


def crawl(start_url: str, html_parser: HtmlParser) -> list[str]:
    host = urlparse(start_url).hostname
    start = normalize(start_url)
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        url = queue.popleft()
        try:
            links = html_parser.get_urls(url)
        except Exception:
            continue            # NOTE: `url` is already in `visited` -- it stays in the result, it just
                                  #  contributes no further links
        for link in links:
            norm = normalize(link)
            if same_host(norm, host) and norm not in visited:
                visited.add(norm)
                queue.append(norm)
    return sorted(visited)
```

Let $V$ be the number of distinct, in-scope normalised URLs reachable from `start_url` (including it) and $L$ the total number of links returned across every `get_urls` call made. `crawl` calls `get_urls` exactly $V$ times and does $O(1)$ work per link with the hash set, so $O(V + L)$ beyond the time those $V$ calls to `get_urls` themselves take — and that time is exactly what Part 2 overlaps.

### Part 2

The queue becomes a `queue.Queue` shared by a fixed pool of `max_workers` threads, each running the same loop: pull a URL, fetch it, and push every newly-discovered link back onto the queue. The one step that needs care is turning "check whether a URL is new, and if so claim it" into a single atomic operation: two threads that both see a not-yet-visited URL at the same instant must not both decide they are the one to crawl it, or `get_urls` would run on it twice. A lock around the combined check-and-add is enough, and it only ever guards that tiny set operation, never the `get_urls` call itself, so no thread holds it while blocked on I/O.

Termination cannot be "stop once the queue looks empty": a queue that is momentarily empty may still have a page in flight whose links have not been pushed yet. `queue.Queue` tracks exactly this with an internal counter of unfinished items, incremented by every `put` and decremented by every matching `task_done`; `Queue.join()` blocks, with no polling or spinning, until that counter reaches zero — which is precisely the point where every URL ever queued has finished being processed, including whatever it went on to queue in turn.

```python
import threading
from queue import Queue


def crawl_concurrent(start_url: str, html_parser: HtmlParser, max_workers: int = 8) -> list[str]:
    host = urlparse(start_url).hostname
    start = normalize(start_url)

    visited = {start}
    visited_lock = threading.Lock()
    frontier: Queue = Queue()
    frontier.put(start)

    def worker() -> None:
        while True:
            url = frontier.get()
            if url is None:                     # NOTE: shutdown sentinel -- see below
                frontier.task_done()
                return
            try:
                links = html_parser.get_urls(url)
            except Exception:
                links = []                       # NOTE: `url` stays in `visited`; see Part 1
            for link in links:
                norm = normalize(link)
                if not same_host(norm, host):
                    continue
                with visited_lock:                # NOTE: check-and-add as one atomic step -- whichever
                    if norm in visited:              #  thread wins the race is the only one that queues
                        continue                      #  (and later fetches) this URL
                    visited.add(norm)
                frontier.put(norm)                # NOTE: every child is queued BEFORE task_done() below,
            frontier.task_done()                  #  so the unfinished-item count can never touch zero
                                                    #  while a child of this page is still unaccounted for

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(max_workers)]
    for t in threads:
        t.start()

    frontier.join()              # NOTE: blocks with no busy-waiting until every put() is matched by a
                                   #  task_done() -- correct regardless of how deep or wide the graph is
    for _ in threads:
        frontier.put(None)       # one shutdown sentinel per worker; by now every worker is idle,
    for t in threads:             #  blocked in frontier.get(), so each receives exactly one
        t.join()

    return sorted(visited)
```

`max_workers` threads are started once and reused for the whole crawl, so the pool is bounded regardless of how large the graph turns out to be; `frontier.join()` returning is what proves every reachable page has been fetched, so the shutdown sentinels are only sent once there is provably no more work, and every thread is joined before the function returns.

### Part 3

`crawl_async` keeps the same shape as Part 2 — discover a page's links, filter and claim the new ones, recurse into them — expressed as a coroutine instead of a thread pool. Since `get_urls` is a blocking call, it is run through a `ThreadPoolExecutor` via `loop.run_in_executor`, with an `asyncio.Semaphore` acquired around that call to cap how many fetches are outstanding at once; the executor is sized to exactly `concurrency` threads so it can run every call the semaphore admits without ever leaving one waiting for a free thread. The check-and-add on `visited` needs no lock here: asyncio only ever switches to another coroutine at an `await`, and the membership test and the add that follows it contain none, so no other coroutine can run between them — the single-threaded event loop makes that pair atomic for free.

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


async def crawl_async(start_url: str, html_parser: HtmlParser, concurrency: int = 8) -> list[str]:
    host = urlparse(start_url).hostname
    start = normalize(start_url)
    visited = {start}
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(concurrency)
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=concurrency)

    async def fetch(url: str) -> list[str]:
        async with semaphore:                           # NOTE: caps calls actually running, not tasks created
            try:
                return await loop.run_in_executor(executor, html_parser.get_urls, url)
            except Exception:
                return []                                 # NOTE: `url` stays in `visited`; see Part 1

    async def visit(url: str) -> None:
        links = await fetch(url)
        children = []
        for link in links:
            norm = normalize(link)
            if not same_host(norm, host):
                continue
            if norm not in visited:                     # NOTE: no `await` between this check and the add
                visited.add(norm)                          #  below -- see the paragraph above
                children.append(asyncio.create_task(visit(norm)))
        if children:
            await asyncio.gather(*children)

    try:
        await visit(start)
    finally:
        executor.shutdown(wait=True)                     # NOTE: every pool the page opens is shut down
    return sorted(visited)
```

Termination needs no counter or queue at all here: `crawl_async` returns only once `await visit(start)` does, and `visit` only returns once `asyncio.gather` on every task it created has returned, which in turn holds for each of those, recursively — the whole reachable graph has necessarily been visited before the outermost `await` can complete. This mirrors `Queue.join()` in Part 2, just built from the structure of `await` instead of an explicit counter.

### Follow-ups

- **Threads or processes.** `get_urls` is I/O-bound: the wait for the network happens outside the Python interpreter, so the GIL is free for other threads while any one call is blocked, which is exactly what lets Part 2's threads overlap. A process pool would still work, but its extra cost — spawning workers, pickling arguments and results between processes — buys nothing here, since there is no CPU-bound parsing work to spread across cores; it would earn its keep only if the page content itself needed heavy, pure-Python processing once fetched.
- **`asyncio.gather` vs. `as_completed` vs. a manual semaphore.** `gather` (used above) waits for a fixed set of awaitables and hands back all their results together, or raises as soon as one of them does; `as_completed` yields results one at a time as they finish, useful when the caller wants to react to the fastest pages first rather than wait for a whole batch; a manually managed semaphore-bounded pool, as above, is what is needed once the set of work is not known up front but grows while it is being explored, which is exactly the case for a crawl.
- **robots.txt and per-host politeness.** A real crawler fetches and caches each host's `robots.txt` before its first request there, and rate-limits requests per host (a token bucket keyed by hostname is a common choice) in addition to, not instead of, the global concurrency cap above — otherwise a crawl over many hosts can still hammer any one of them.
- **Timeouts and retries.** A call to `get_urls` that never returns should not stall the whole crawl; wrapping it with a timeout and a bounded number of retries with backoff turns "hung forever" into "eventually treated like a page whose fetch failed," the same outcome already defined above for a raised exception.
- **Multi-machine crawling.** Shard the frontier across machines by a hash of the hostname, so that every page on a given host is always fetched by the same machine and per-host state (rate limits, `robots.txt`) never needs to be shared; replace the in-process `visited` set with a shared store (a distributed hash set, or a table keyed by normalised URL) that every machine checks and updates atomically before fetching a page, and requeue a URL a worker had claimed but not finished if that worker disappears without reporting completion, so a crashed machine loses no work.
- **Depth or page limits.** Bounding the crawl by the number of hops from `start_url`, or by a maximum total page count, keeps a crawl over a very large or pathologically linked site from running unbounded; either is a small addition to the BFS layer structure already used in Part 1.
