Two points worth confirming with the interviewer before starting: whether "symmetric" noise — flipping to a uniformly random other class, as defined above — is the intended corruption model or a specific confusion pattern is expected instead, and whether the 5-seed minimum is a floor or a target, since that changes whether the four hours go toward a wider grid or more seeds on the same one.

### Plan for the four hours

- **0:00–0:15**: Read the prompt, restate the research question, decide the grid and the two tables to fill in.
- **0:15–0:45**: Implement `make_dataset`; check the empirical flip rate matches `noise_rate` and that `X_val`/`X_test` stay clean.
- **0:45–1:15**: Implement the model and one training run; confirm the noise-free condition converges before trusting anything noisy.
- **1:15–2:45**: Run all 18 conditions × 5 seeds with early-stopping tracking — the only step with real runtime.
- **2:45–3:30**: Fill in the tables, look for the trends, draft the interpretation and the limitations.
- **3:30–4:00**: Build the ten-minute presentation outline; rehearse answers to likely follow-up questions.

### Part 1 — Data and model

The hidden layer uses He initialization (`std = sqrt(2 / fan_in)`), appropriate for ReLU units; both weight matrices are drawn this way regardless of $H$, so only the width changes between the narrow and the wide network and the comparison in Part 2 isolates capacity from anything else about the initialization. Training is full-batch gradient descent, not mini-batches or Adam: with $n_{\text{train}} \le 1600$ the whole training set is one matrix multiply, full-batch removes stochastic-gradient noise as a second source of seed-to-seed variance on top of the data draw and the label-noise draw, and it keeps the 90 independent training runs of Part 2 (18 conditions × 5 seeds) fast enough for the four-hour budget. `train_with_early_stopping` keeps a *snapshot* of the weights at the best-validation epoch instead of storing per-epoch predictions on `X_test`: the test set is read exactly twice per run, after the last epoch and once more after restoring the best-validation snapshot, never to choose anything, only to report it.

```python

    def __init__(self, d_in: int, d_hidden: int, d_out: int, seed: int):
        rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
        self.W1 = rng.normal(0, np.sqrt(2.0 / d_in), size=(d_in, d_hidden))

        return Z1, H, P

```

### Part 2 — The grid: noise, training-set size, and capacity

Eighty epochs of full-batch gradient descent at `lr=0.5` with weight decay `1e-3` were enough for the noise-free ($p=0.0$) condition to plateau at every training-set size tried, so that schedule was kept fixed across the whole grid, deliberately not retuned per cell — a choice revisited in the Interpretation below.

```python
EPOCHS, LR, L2 = 80, 0.5, 1e-3
SEEDS = range(5)
N_TRAINS = [100, 400, 1600]
NOISES = [0.0, 0.2, 0.4]
HIDDENS = [8, 128]

results = {}
for n_train in N_TRAINS:
    for hidden in HIDDENS:
        for noise in NOISES:
            finals, bests, best_epochs = [], [], []
            for seed in SEEDS:
                X_train, y_noisy, y_true, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test = make_dataset(seed, n_train, noise)
                model, best_snapshot, best_epoch = train_with_early_stopping(
                    X_train, y_noisy, X_val, y_val, hidden, seed, EPOCHS, LR, L2)
                finals.append((model.predict(X_test) == y_test).mean())
                model.restore(best_snapshot)
                bests.append((model.predict(X_test) == y_test).mean())
                best_epochs.append(best_epoch)
            results[(n_train, hidden, noise)] = dict(
                final_mean=np.mean(finals), final_std=np.std(finals),
                best_mean=np.mean(bests), best_std=np.std(bests),
                best_epoch_mean=np.mean(best_epochs),
            )
```

**Table 1 — final-epoch test accuracy** (mean ± standard deviation over 5 seeds):

- $n_{\text{train}}$: 100 · $H$: 8 · $p=0.0$: 0.869 ± 0.029 · $p=0.2$: 0.736 ± 0.043 · $p=0.4$: 0.542 ± 0.072
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 100 · $H$: 128 · $p=0.0$: 0.879 ± 0.025 · $p=0.2$: 0.749 ± 0.036 · $p=0.4$: 0.594 ± 0.060
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 400 · $H$: 8 · $p=0.0$: 0.937 ± 0.008 · $p=0.2$: 0.833 ± 0.031 · $p=0.4$: 0.663 ± 0.049
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 400 · $H$: 128 · $p=0.0$: 0.949 ± 0.011 · $p=0.2$: 0.816 ± 0.014 · $p=0.4$: 0.615 ± 0.069
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 1600 · $H$: 8 · $p=0.0$: 0.964 ± 0.009 · $p=0.2$: 0.930 ± 0.011 · $p=0.4$: 0.875 ± 0.020
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 1600 · $H$: 128 · $p=0.0$: 0.964 ± 0.005 · $p=0.2$: 0.868 ± 0.021 · $p=0.4$: 0.724 ± 0.041

Two trends hold at every one of the six $(n_{\text{train}}, H)$ pairs: accuracy falls as $p$ goes from 0.0 to 0.2 to 0.4 (the smallest step anywhere in the table is 0.034, at $n_{\text{train}}=1600$, $H=8$; every other step is larger), and accuracy at $n_{\text{train}}=1600$ is higher than at $n_{\text{train}}=100$ under noise (the smallest such gap is 0.119, at $H=128$, $p=0.2$). Neither trend is a surprise by itself; the more specific finding is how $H$ interacts with $n_{\text{train}}$. At $n_{\text{train}}=100$ the wide network ($H=128$) is not worse than the narrow one under noise — if anything it is slightly ahead, 0.594 against 0.542 at $p=0.4$. At $n_{\text{train}}=1600$ the ranking reverses and the gap widens sharply: the narrow network reaches 0.875 at $p=0.4$ against the wide network's 0.724, a gap of 0.151 — roughly three times the 0.052 gap in the *other* direction at $n_{\text{train}}=100$. More capacity is not uniformly harmful under noise; it is harmful specifically once there is enough training data for the extra capacity to be spent memorizing mislabeled points rather than fitting the shared pattern. With only 100 points, both networks already have far more parameters than data — the narrow one alone has $20 \times 8 + 8 \times 3 = 184$ weights in its two layers — so neither has more room than the other to overfit.

### Part 3 — Does early stopping recover the loss?

**Table 2 — recovery** (mean test accuracy at the best-validation epoch, minus mean test accuracy at the final epoch, over the same 5 seeds):

- $n_{\text{train}}$: 100 · $H$: 8 · $p=0.0$: -0.002 · $p=0.2$: 0.039 · $p=0.4$: 0.069
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 100 · $H$: 128 · $p=0.0$: -0.006 · $p=0.2$: 0.038 · $p=0.4$: 0.024
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 400 · $H$: 8 · $p=0.0$: -0.005 · $p=0.2$: 0.025 · $p=0.4$: 0.064
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 400 · $H$: 128 · $p=0.0$: -0.003 · $p=0.2$: 0.037 · $p=0.4$: 0.076
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 1600 · $H$: 8 · $p=0.0$: -0.006 · $p=0.2$: 0.000 · $p=0.4$: -0.015
- $n_{\text{train}}$: 1600 · $H$: 128 · $p=0.0$: -0.002 · $p=0.2$: 0.029 · $p=0.4$: 0.016

At $p=0.0$ every recovery is small and negative — between -0.006 and -0.002, averaging -0.004 over the six conditions — which is what a validation-based stopping rule should do when there is nothing to protect against: it neither helps nor meaningfully hurts. At $p=0.4$ the average recovery is 0.039, roughly ten times larger in magnitude, and five of the six conditions gain; the exception is $n_{\text{train}}=1600$, $H=8$ (-0.015), the same condition whose capacity is too small, relative to that much clean data, to memorize the noise in the first place — with nothing pathological to correct, choosing an earlier epoch by validation accuracy alone gives up a little of the training the last few epochs would still have added. The largest single recovery is +0.076, at $n_{\text{train}}=400$, $H=128$, $p=0.4$. Consistent with the capacity story in Part 2, the wide network's validation accuracy peaks early when data is scarce and noise is high: at $n_{\text{train}}=100$, $H=128$, $p=0.4$ the mean best epoch is 9.8 of 80, against 64.4 for $n_{\text{train}}=1600$, $H=8$, $p=0.4$ — an order of magnitude sooner.

### Interpretation

The evidence supports three claims without much qualification, because every comparison behind them clears a margin several times the seed-to-seed spread observed anywhere in the grid: accuracy decreases monotonically in the noise rate, at every capacity and every training-set size tested; accuracy at $n_{\text{train}}=1600$ exceeds accuracy at $n_{\text{train}}=100$ under noise, at every capacity and both noisy conditions; and the capacity penalty under noise — how much worse the wide network does than the narrow one — is far larger at $n_{\text{train}}=1600$ than at $n_{\text{train}}=100$, where it is not a penalty at all.

It supports one claim only loosely: that accuracy rises *monotonically* with training-set size at every single condition, rather than just at the two endpoints. At $H=128$, $p=0.4$, the step from $n_{\text{train}}=100$ to $400$ is 0.021 (0.594 to 0.615), smaller than the standard error of either mean (≈ 0.027 and 0.031 over 5 seeds); the step from 400 to 1600 is 0.109, several times either standard error and not in doubt. Five seeds settle the large, order-of-magnitude comparisons in this study and do not settle a 0.02-sized one — a concrete instance of the general rule that the number of seeds needed scales with how small a difference must be resolved, not with the size of the grid.

It does not support a claim about capacity in general. The learning rate, epoch budget, and weight decay were fixed once, from the noise-free condition in Part 2, and reused for both hidden widths rather than retuned per condition. If `lr=0.5` undertrains the wide network relative to the narrow one, part of the measured capacity penalty could be an optimization artifact rather than a pure capacity effect — a confound this design cannot rule out on its own. Nor does it support any claim beyond this data-generating process: one synthetic family, one class separation, symmetric noise only, and two capacity points rather than a curve.

### Limitations and next steps

- Five seeds order effects that differ by several standard errors but not ones that do not — see the $n_{\text{train}}=100 \to 400$ step above; a handful of other cells in the two tables are likely similarly close and were not individually checked.
- The training hyperparameters were chosen once, from the noise-free condition, and reused everywhere; the Interpretation above already flags what this could be hiding in the capacity comparison specifically.
- Only two hidden widths were tried. Together they establish that a crossover exists somewhere between 8 and 128 units relative to $n_{\text{train}} \le 1600$, not where it is or how sharp it is.
- Noise here is symmetric and label-only: every wrong label is equally likely, and the features themselves are never corrupted. Real label noise is often class-conditional (some classes are confused with specific others far more than uniformly) or instance-dependent (harder examples are mislabeled more often); neither is represented here.
- The validation set used for early stopping is clean. A more realistic setting — validation labels drawn from the same noisy process as training — would plausibly show a smaller recovery, since the stopping criterion would itself be corrupted.

With a second day: retune the learning rate and epoch budget per hidden width before rerunning the capacity comparison; add two or three intermediate hidden widths to trace the crossover as a curve rather than two points; replace symmetric noise with a fixed class-confusion matrix and check whether the interaction survives; and raise the seed count specifically on the conditions flagged as close, rather than uniformly across the whole grid.

### The ten-minute presentation

Ten minutes, six slides, timed to leave the full 30 minutes after for questions:

```text
1. Question (30s): one sentence, does label noise interact with training-set size and capacity, and
   does early stopping buy any of it back?
2. Setup (1.5 min): the data generator, the one-hidden-layer model, the three grid axes, 5 seeds each.
3. Result 1 (2 min): Table 1, noise always hurts, more data always helps; then the capacity crossover,
   narrow at least matches wide at n=100, narrow beats wide by far at n=1600.
4. Result 2 (2 min): Table 2, early stopping recovers noise-driven loss on average and costs nothing
   at p=0.0, with one clean exception explained by the same capacity story.
5. What the data does and does not support (2.5 min): the fragile 100-to-400 step at H=128; the fixed
   learning rate as a confound for the capacity claim specifically.
6. With more time (1.5 min): retune per condition, trace the crossover, class-conditional noise, more
   seeds where it matters.
```

### Follow-ups

- Why symmetric noise instead of a more realistic corruption model? It has one parameter, its effect can be verified empirically against the requested rate, and it is the standard control condition more realistic noise models (class-conditional, instance-dependent) are usually compared against first.
- Why full-batch gradient descent rather than Adam or mini-batches? Determinism and speed at this scale ($n_{\text{train}} \le 1600$): it removes stochastic-gradient noise as a source of seed-to-seed variance on top of the data draw and the label-noise draw, and 90 independent training runs stay well inside the time budget.
- What would change the capacity-crossover conclusion? Retuning the learning rate separately for each hidden width — the current comparison holds it fixed, so part of the effect could be an optimization artifact rather than a pure capacity effect.
- Why 5 seeds and not more? The four-hour budget; the write-up names exactly which comparison that seed count leaves too close to call (the $n_{\text{train}}=100 \to 400$ step at $H=128$, $p=0.4$) rather than treating every trend in the tables as equally certain.
- What would you do with two more days? Retune hyperparameters per condition, add intermediate hidden widths to trace the crossover, and repeat with class-conditional noise.
- How do you know early stopping is not simply regularizing away the model's ability to fit anything, clean labels included? The $p=0.0$ row: every recovery there is small and negative, so the same stopping rule that helps under noise does not manufacture a gain when there is nothing to correct.
