Two points worth confirming before starting: whether every image and every pipeline file can be assumed well-formed (assumed here for all three parts; Follow-ups covers a corrupt image, an unknown step type and a bad parameter), and whether the checker compares pixels against a specific library's output bit-for-bit — Pillow's own operations are used throughout, with the exact filters and rounding stated in the Problem, so the answer is exact once that library choice is settled.

### Part 1

`apply_step` is the single place that knows what each of the six `"type"` values means; every later part reuses it unchanged. Pillow's `convert`, `transpose`, `resize`, `filter` and `rotate` all return a new `Image` rather than modifying their receiver, so `run_pipeline` can reassign `image` on every iteration without worrying about aliasing, and `process_images` can decode one image and feed it to every one of its pipelines: none of them can see, let alone undo, what an earlier pipeline did to that same starting point.

```python
import json
import os

from PIL import Image, ImageFilter


def apply_step(image, step):
    kind = step["type"]
    if kind == "grayscale":
        return image.convert("L")
    if kind == "flip_horizontal":
        return image.transpose(Image.Transpose.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT)
    if kind == "flip_vertical":
        return image.transpose(Image.Transpose.FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM)
    if kind == "scale":
        factor = step["factor"]
        # NOTE: round(), not int() -- truncating would bias every scaled dimension down
        new_size = (max(1, round(image.width * factor)), max(1, round(image.height * factor)))
        return image.resize(new_size, resample=Image.Resampling.BILINEAR)
    if kind == "blur":
        return image.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=step["radius"]))
    if kind == "rotate":
        return image.rotate(step["angle"], resample=Image.Resampling.BILINEAR, expand=True)
    raise ValueError(f"unknown transformation type: {kind!r}")


def run_pipeline(image, steps):
    for step in steps:
        image = apply_step(image, step)
    return image


def _load_transformations(transformation_dir):
    """json_name -> its ordered list of steps."""
    steps_by_json = {}
    for json_name in sorted(os.listdir(transformation_dir)):
        with open(os.path.join(transformation_dir, json_name)) as f:
            steps_by_json[json_name] = json.load(f)["transformations"]
    return steps_by_json


def process_images(image_dir, transformation_dir, output_dir, get_output_path):
    steps_by_json = _load_transformations(transformation_dir)
    for image_name in sorted(os.listdir(image_dir)):
        with Image.open(os.path.join(image_dir, image_name)) as base:
            base.load()  # decode once per image
            for json_name, steps in steps_by_json.items():
                # NOTE: base is reused for every json_name -- safe since apply_step never mutates it
                run_pipeline(base, steps).save(get_output_path(image_name, json_name), format="PNG")
```

For $N$ images and $M$ pipelines whose lengths sum to $S$ steps, this makes exactly $N$ calls to `Image.open` and $N \times S$ calls to `apply_step`, all in one process, one core.

### Part 2

`process_images` is single-core by construction: every one of its $N \times S$ steps runs on the same interpreter, one after another. Pillow's transformations are CPU-bound — each spends its time computing new pixel values, not waiting on anything — so the natural way to use more than one core is `ProcessPoolExecutor`: each worker is a separate operating-system process with its own interpreter and its own GIL, so $W$ workers really do run $W$ steps at once. A `ThreadPoolExecutor` sharing one interpreter cannot do that for ordinary Python code, since the GIL lets only one thread run Python bytecode at a time — but Pillow's C extension is not ordinary Python code: it releases the GIL around several of its heaviest per-pixel loops, including decoding, `resize`, and the convolution-based filter that `GaussianBlur` compiles down to. Threads calling into exactly those operations do overlap on separate cores, but everything else — `json.load`, dictionary bookkeeping, the interpreter overhead of every `apply_step` call — stays serialized; a process pool parallelizes the whole worker unconditionally instead, which is why `process_images_parallel` uses one (Follow-ups covers when a thread pool becomes competitive).

Crossing a process boundary costs something too: every argument passed to a worker, and every value it returns, is pickled and sent through a pipe. A decoded `Image` pickles its full pixel buffer, so handing one to a worker — or handing a processed one back instead of saving it there — can cost more than the transformation itself; workers are given the image's *path* instead. Grouping one image with every pipeline that applies to it into a single task, rather than submitting $N \times M$ separate one-pipeline tasks, means a worker calls `Image.open` on that path exactly once no matter how many pipelines follow. `get_output_path` itself never crosses the boundary either: it is a plain, arbitrary callable that is not guaranteed to be picklable, so every output path is resolved once in the main process and only the resulting strings travel to the worker.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor


def _process_one_image(task):
    image_path, steps_by_json, output_paths = task
    with Image.open(image_path) as base:  # NOTE: decode from a path, inside the worker -- not a pickled Image
        base.load()
        for json_name, steps in steps_by_json.items():
            run_pipeline(base, steps).save(output_paths[json_name], format="PNG")


def _dispatch(image_dir, transformation_dir, output_dir, get_output_path, worker, max_workers):
    steps_by_json = _load_transformations(transformation_dir)
    tasks = []
    for image_name in sorted(os.listdir(image_dir)):
        image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, image_name)
        # NOTE: resolved here, in the main process -- get_output_path itself never has to be picklable
        output_paths = {json_name: get_output_path(image_name, json_name) for json_name in steps_by_json}
        tasks.append((image_path, steps_by_json, output_paths))
    workers = max_workers or os.cpu_count() or 1
    chunksize = max(1, len(tasks) // (4 * workers))  # fewer IPC round-trips when there are many images
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as pool:
        return list(pool.map(worker, tasks, chunksize=chunksize))


def process_images_parallel(image_dir, transformation_dir, output_dir, get_output_path, max_workers=None):
    _dispatch(image_dir, transformation_dir, output_dir, get_output_path, _process_one_image, max_workers)
```

The $N \times S$ calls to `apply_step` are unchanged in count from Part 1 — only their distribution across cores changes — so the best possible speed-up is bounded by $\min(W, N)$: an image's own pipelines all run inside the one task that decoded it, so if there are far fewer images than cores and each has many pipelines, most of the pool sits idle. Part 3 does not change that cap; it reduces how much work is inside each task, not how many tasks there are. Splitting one image's pipelines across several tasks would widen the cap at the cost of decoding that image more than once — which trade wins depends on how expensive decoding is relative to the transformations that follow it.

### Part 3

Grouping every pipeline under one task, as Part 2 already does, is what makes sharing possible without adding any communication between workers: an image's pipelines are only ever compared against each other inside the single task that already holds all of them and its one decoded copy of the image, so two pipelines never discover a shared prefix unless the same worker happens to own both of them — which grouping by image guarantees.

Two steps are the same node in the trie only if their `"type"` and every parameter match, checked by comparing `sorted(step.items())` rather than the step dictionaries' own key order: JSON does not promise which order a step's keys were written in, and two files describing the identical step with their keys swapped must still share. `_build_trie` walks every pipeline's steps from the root, reusing a child whenever the next step's key already exists at the current node, and records which json names end at each node — a pipeline may end at a node that also has children, when its steps are an exact prefix of a longer pipeline's.

`_run_trie` is a plain depth-first walk: apply this node's own step to the image its parent computed, save an output for every pipeline ending here, then recurse into every child before returning. `image` is a local variable, so it is kept alive only by the stack frames between the root and whichever node is currently being visited — at most one image per depth, bounded by the longest pipeline sharing this image, never one per distinct prefix in the whole trie at once. No step here needs to defensively copy `image` before branching into more than one child: since `apply_step` never mutates its input (Part 1), the same `image` object can be handed to every child of a node without one child's continuation affecting another's — a property of exactly these six transformations, worth re-examining before adding a step implemented with an in-place Pillow call such as `ImageDraw` or `Image.paste`.

```python
def _step_key(step):
    # NOTE: sorted() so a step's own JSON key order never matters for matching it against another
    return tuple(sorted(step.items()))


class _TrieNode:
    __slots__ = ("step", "children", "leaves")

    def __init__(self, step=None):
        self.step = step      # the step that produced this node's image from its parent's; None at the root
        self.children = {}    # _step_key(step) -> _TrieNode
        self.leaves = []      # json_names whose pipeline ends exactly at this node


def _build_trie(steps_by_json):
    root = _TrieNode()
    for json_name, steps in steps_by_json.items():
        node = root
        for step in steps:
            key = _step_key(step)
            if key not in node.children:  # NOTE: children is per-node, so the same step reached via a
                node.children[key] = _TrieNode(step)  # different prefix still gets its own node here
            node = node.children[key]
        node.leaves.append(json_name)
    return root


def _run_trie(node, image, output_paths):
    if node.step is not None:
        image = apply_step(image, node.step)
    applications = 0 if node.step is None else 1
    for json_name in node.leaves:
        image.save(output_paths[json_name], format="PNG")
    for child in node.children.values():
        applications += _run_trie(child, image, output_paths)
    return applications


def _process_one_image_shared_prefix(task):
    image_path, steps_by_json, output_paths = task
    trie = _build_trie(steps_by_json)
    with Image.open(image_path) as base:
        base.load()
        return _run_trie(trie, base, output_paths)


def process_images_shared_prefix(image_dir, transformation_dir, output_dir, get_output_path, max_workers=None):
    _dispatch(image_dir, transformation_dir, output_dir, get_output_path, _process_one_image_shared_prefix,
              max_workers)
```

For one image with pipelines of lengths $L_1, \dots, L_J$, sharing turns $\sum_j L_j$ applications of `apply_step` (Part 2's count) into exactly the number of distinct nodes in the trie — at most $\sum_j L_j$, when no two pipelines share anything, and as low as $\max_j L_j$, when every pipeline is a prefix of the longest one. `_run_trie`'s own return value counts that number directly, one per call that actually applied a step.

### Follow-ups

- A corrupt image is skipped entirely — no output for any of its pairs, since nothing about it can be trusted — while a step with an unknown `"type"` or a missing or invalid parameter fails only the one `(image, json)` pair it belongs to; both are recorded rather than raised all the way up, so one bad file never aborts the batch.
- A `ThreadPoolExecutor` built the same way (one task per image) is worth it once profiling shows the workload is dominated by the GIL-releasing Pillow calls, or once there are enough images that $W$ processes' fixed memory overhead outweighs the residual GIL contention; threads also need no pickling and can share one read-only cache of decoded images across every task, which a process pool cannot do without extra machinery.
- An ordinary JPEG or PNG is decoded whole the first time a pixel is touched, so an image larger than memory has to avoid ever reaching that point at full resolution: `Image.draft(mode, size)` lets Pillow's JPEG decoder produce a smaller image directly, and a genuinely tiled format read through a library built for it (`pyvips`, `rasterio`) can be processed strip by strip — grayscale, the flips and blur are local enough for that (blur needs each strip read with a margin of about `3 * radius` pixels so the kernel has real neighbours at the seam), but rotate mixes pixels from across the whole image and resists clean tiling regardless of the library.
- To find the bottleneck, time a representative batch two ways: with every step, and with the transformations skipped so only decode and re-encode remain. A gap between the two that scales with core count is CPU time inside the transformations; a wall-clock time that does not shrink as workers are added, while each worker's CPU usage stays low, points at disk or network I/O instead.
- Across several machines, partition images — not individual pairs — by a hash of the image name, so each machine's share is disjoint and it can run Part 2 or Part 3 unchanged against its own share; keep prefix sharing local to each machine's workers, since shipping a decoded intermediate over the network almost always costs more than recomputing it.
