Worth confirming up front: that file content is genuinely out of scope, so a size is the only thing tracked, and that `find_files`'s prefix and suffix are meant literally as `str.startswith` and `str.endswith`, not a glob or a regular expression.

### Level 1

The store is one `dict` from name to size; every method is a direct lookup or write.

```python
class CloudStorage:
    def __init__(self):
        self._files: dict[str, int] = {}

    def add_file(self, name: str, size: int) -> bool:
        if name in self._files:
            return False
        self._files[name] = size
        return True

    def copy_file(self, source: str, destination: str) -> bool:
        if source not in self._files or destination in self._files:
            return False
        self._files[destination] = self._files[source]
        return True

    def get_file_size(self, name: str) -> int | None:
        return self._files.get(name)
```

All three run in $O(1)$.

### Level 2

`find_files` filters `_files` in one pass and sorts the matches; negating the size sorts it descending while `sorted` keeps names ascending, so a single key does both at once.

```python
def find_files(self, prefix: str, suffix: str) -> list[str]:
    matches = [(name, size) for name, size in self._files.items()
               if name.startswith(prefix) and name.endswith(suffix)]
    matches.sort(key=lambda item: (-item[1], item[0]))    # NOTE: size descending, then name ascending
    return [f"{name}({size})" for name, size in matches]


CloudStorage.find_files = find_files
```

Filtering the whole store is $O(n)$ for $n$ files, and sorting the $k$ matches adds $O(k \log k)$.

### Level 3

Ownership and capacity live in two more dicts alongside `_files`: `_owner` names the user who owns a file, absent for a file `add_file` created, and `_used` tracks each user's total bytes charged so far, so a remaining capacity is one subtraction away.

```python
_init_l2 = CloudStorage.__init__


def __init__(self):
    _init_l2(self)
    self._owner: dict[str, str] = {}      # file name -> owning user id (absent: unowned)
    self._capacity: dict[str, int] = {}   # user id -> total capacity
    self._used: dict[str, int] = {}       # user id -> bytes currently charged to it


def _remaining(self, user_id: str) -> int:
    return self._capacity[user_id] - self._used[user_id]


def add_user(self, user_id: str, capacity: int) -> bool:
    if user_id in self._capacity:
        return False
    self._capacity[user_id] = capacity
    self._used[user_id] = 0
    return True


def add_file_by(self, user_id: str, name: str, size: int) -> int | None:
    if user_id not in self._capacity or name in self._files:
        return None
    if size > self._remaining(user_id):        # NOTE: capacity checked before any mutation
        return None
    self._files[name] = size
    self._owner[name] = user_id
    self._used[user_id] += size
    return self._remaining(user_id)


def copy_file(self, source: str, destination: str) -> bool:
    if source not in self._files or destination in self._files:
        return False
    size = self._files[source]
    owner = self._owner.get(source)
    if owner is not None and size > self._remaining(owner):    # NOTE: a copy counts against SOURCE's owner
        return False
    self._files[destination] = size
    if owner is not None:
        self._owner[destination] = owner
        self._used[owner] += size
    return True


def merge_user(self, target: str, source: str) -> int | None:
    if target == source or target not in self._capacity or source not in self._capacity:
        return None                              # NOTE: forbids a self-merge that would double one's own capacity
    for name, owner in self._owner.items():
        if owner == source:
            self._owner[name] = target
    self._capacity[target] += self._capacity[source]
    self._used[target] += self._used[source]
    del self._capacity[source]
    del self._used[source]
    return self._remaining(target)


CloudStorage.__init__ = __init__
CloudStorage._remaining = _remaining
CloudStorage.add_user = add_user
CloudStorage.add_file_by = add_file_by
CloudStorage.copy_file = copy_file
CloudStorage.merge_user = merge_user
```

`merge_user` adds the two capacities and the two used-totals separately, rather than recomputing either from the files themselves; the result can never make `_remaining(target)` negative, because each user's own used total never exceeded their own capacity before the merge, and the sum of two such inequalities is the same inequality for the sums.

`add_user`, `add_file_by` and `copy_file` are $O(1)$; `merge_user` is $O(f)$ in the number of files the whole store currently holds, since it scans every entry of `_owner` to find `source`'s files.

### Level 4

`compress_file` and `decompress_file` both remove one file and insert another, adjusting `_used` by the difference between the two sizes. `backup_user` copies out exactly the pairs `restore_user` will need; `restore_user` treats that snapshot as the desired state and the current ownership as the actual one, and reconciles the two with a set difference on names alone — a name present on both sides is left untouched, which is what makes the freed-and-reused-name case described above possible.

```python
COMPRESSED_SUFFIX = ".cmp"

_init_l3 = CloudStorage.__init__


def __init__(self):
    _init_l3(self)
    self._backups: dict[str, tuple[int, dict[str, int]]] = {}    # user id -> (capacity, {name: size})


def compress_file(self, user_id: str, name: str) -> str | None:
    if user_id not in self._capacity or self._owner.get(name) != user_id:   # NOTE: also covers "no such file"
        return None
    new_name = name + COMPRESSED_SUFFIX
    if new_name in self._files:
        return None                              # NOTE: compressed-name collision
    size = self._files.pop(name)
    del self._owner[name]
    self._used[user_id] -= size
    new_size = -(-size // 2)                     # NOTE: ceiling division -- never rounds size 1 down to 0
    self._files[new_name] = new_size
    self._owner[new_name] = user_id
    self._used[user_id] += new_size              # NOTE: never exceeds capacity: new_size <= size always
    return new_name


def decompress_file(self, user_id: str, name: str) -> str | None:
    if user_id not in self._capacity or self._owner.get(name) != user_id:
        return None
    if not name.endswith(COMPRESSED_SUFFIX):
        return None
    new_name = name[:-len(COMPRESSED_SUFFIX)]
    if new_name in self._files:
        return None
    size = self._files[name]
    if size > self._remaining(user_id):          # NOTE: name itself still counts here -- see the level text
        return None
    del self._files[name]
    del self._owner[name]
    self._used[user_id] -= size
    new_size = size * 2
    self._files[new_name] = new_size
    self._owner[new_name] = user_id
    self._used[user_id] += new_size
    return new_name


def backup_user(self, user_id: str) -> bool:
    if user_id not in self._capacity:
        return False
    owned = {name: size for name, size in self._files.items() if self._owner.get(name) == user_id}
    self._backups[user_id] = (self._capacity[user_id], owned)     # NOTE: replaces any earlier backup
    return True


def restore_user(self, user_id: str) -> int | None:
    if user_id not in self._capacity or user_id not in self._backups:
        return None
    snap_capacity, snap_files = self._backups[user_id]
    current = {name for name, owner in self._owner.items() if owner == user_id}
    to_delete = current - snap_files.keys()       # owned now, not in the snapshot

    # NOTE: recomputed from what user_id actually owns now, NOT sum(snap_files.values()) -- a name kept
    # untouched because it was owned at backup time and still is now is not re-verified against its
    # backed-up size, so the snapshot's own total can be stale (see the level text).
    self._used[user_id] = sum(size for name, size in self._files.items() if self._owner.get(name) == user_id)
    return self._remaining(user_id)


CloudStorage.__init__ = __init__
CloudStorage.compress_file = compress_file
CloudStorage.decompress_file = decompress_file
CloudStorage.backup_user = backup_user
CloudStorage.restore_user = restore_user
```

$\lceil s/2 \rceil \le s$ for every $s \ge 1$, so `compress_file` can only reduce what its owner has used and never needs a capacity check; `decompress_file` increases it by exactly the current, pre-decompression `size` (the doubled file replaces one already counted at `size`), which is exactly what is compared against `_remaining`. `restore_user` checks every `to_create` name against the whole store, not only against `user_id`'s own files, and does so before deleting or creating anything, so a restore that cannot fully succeed leaves every file and every capacity exactly as it was.

`compress_file` and `decompress_file` are $O(1)$; `backup_user` and `restore_user` are $O(f)$ in the number of files the store currently holds.

### Follow-ups

- Why do `merge_user`, `backup_user` and `restore_user` each scan every file in the store instead of just the ones one user owns? A per-user `dict[str, set[str]]` of owned names, kept current at every mutation site, would make each of them linear in that user's own files instead.
- What if a user needed more than one backup at a time? `_backups[user_id]` would become a dict keyed by a caller-supplied label, and `restore_user` would take that label as a second argument.
- Why does `decompress_file` not always undo a matching `compress_file` exactly? Ceiling division loses the low bit of an odd size, and doubling cannot bring it back; a lossless scheme would need to store that bit somewhere, such as in the compressed file's own size being odd or even.
- File content is never stored, so `compress_file`'s ratio is fixed at exactly one half. A production version would take the compressed size, or a ratio measured from the actual bytes, as an argument instead of assuming a constant.
