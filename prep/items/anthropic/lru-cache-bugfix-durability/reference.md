Two points are worth confirming before coding. First, whether a positional argument and an equal-valued keyword argument to the same parameter should hit the same entry — here they do not, since `generate_key` has no access to `func`'s signature (binding against `inspect.signature(func)` first would unify them; see the follow-ups). Second, how strict "durable" must be: whether a crash may ever be seen to have rewound the recency order (here it may not — a hit is exactly as durable as a miss, at the `fsync` cost the complexity note in Part 2 gives) and whether values may be restricted to JSON rather than `pickle` (chosen here, since unpickling runs arbitrary code for whatever bytes happen to be on disk, so a record damaged by a crash cannot be safely inspected before deciding whether to trust it, while a damaged JSON record just fails to parse).

### Part 1

Bug 1, in `generate_key`: `kwargs.items()` is folded into the key in whatever order Python iterates it, which is insertion order — the order the caller happened to write the keywords in. Sorting by name first removes the dependence: `sorted(kwargs.items())` compares its tuples element by element, and since dictionary keys are unique, two tuples built this way are never compared past their first element, so sorting never fails even when the argument values themselves are not orderable.

Bug 2, also in `generate_key`: folding `args` and `kwargs.items()` into one flat tuple loses the boundary between them the moment that flat tuple happens to have exactly one element, because of the `len(key) == 1` special case that returns `key[0]` unwrapped. `f(1, 2)` builds the two-element tuple `(1, 2)` from `args` alone; `f((1, 2))` builds the one-element tuple `((1, 2),)`, which the special case then unwraps to that very same `(1, 2)`. Keeping `args` and the sorted keyword pairs as two separate elements of one outer tuple, instead of flattening them together, fixes this at the root (see the code comment below).

Bug 3, in `__call__`: a hit returns `self.cache[key]` without calling `self.cache.move_to_end(key)`, so the `OrderedDict`'s order only ever reflects *insertion*, never *use* — repeated hits on the same key leave it exactly where it was first inserted, and `popitem(last=False)` then evicts whichever key was inserted longest ago, which is FIFO, not LRU, the moment any key is used more than once.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
from typing import Any, Callable


class Memoize:
    """Wraps func so that repeated calls with the same arguments return a cached result instead of
    calling func again. Holds at most capacity entries; a call that would add a new one beyond that
    evicts the least recently used entry first. Both a hit and a miss count as a "use" of the key
    they touch, for the purpose of deciding which entry is least recently used."""

    def __init__(self, func: Callable, capacity: int) -> None:
        self.func = func
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache: "OrderedDict[Any, Any]" = OrderedDict()
        self.hits = 0
        self.misses = 0

    def generate_key(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        # NOTE: args and the sorted kwargs stay two separate elements of one outer tuple, rather
        # than being flattened together, so no split between them can ever collide with another
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

    def __call__(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        key = self.generate_key(*args, **kwargs)
        if key in self.cache:
            self.hits += 1
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)  # NOTE: a hit is a use too -- without this the cache degrades to FIFO
            return self.cache[key]
        self.misses += 1
        result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)
        self.cache[key] = result
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)
        return result
```

`generate_key` and `__call__` are both $O(1)$ expected, dominated by hashing the key and a constant number of dictionary operations; `sorted(kwargs.items())` costs $O(k \log k)$ in the number of keyword arguments passed to that one call, never in `capacity`.

### Part 2

Each call appends one *record* to a single log file: a `PUT` record on a miss (key and value), a lightweight `TOUCH` record on a hit (key alone — the value is already known and does not need to be written again). Recovery replays the log in order on top of the most recent snapshot (empty, the first time): a `PUT` sets the key's value and moves it to the most-recently-used end, evicting under the same capacity rule `__call__` uses if that overflows; a `TOUCH` moves an already-present key to that end. No record marks an eviction directly (see the follow-ups).

Each record is framed by a fixed 8-byte big-endian length and a 4-byte CRC-32 ahead of the payload — a JSON document holding the operation and the key, plus the value for a `PUT`. The checksum covers the length field, not just the payload: over the payload alone, a torn write of exactly 12 zero bytes — a plausible shape for a crash mid-write — would pass as a valid, empty-payload record, since `zlib.crc32(b"")` is `0` and matches a zeroed checksum field by coincidence; folding the length in makes that same all-zero header fail its own checksum instead. A record is trusted only once its declared length is followed by that many bytes and the checksum matches; replay stops at the first record that fails, and the log is truncated back to the end of the last good one, since nothing past a bad fragment would ever be reached by a later replay.

A key is `(args, sorted_kwargs)`, built from tuples; `json.dumps` already turns a nested `tuple` into a JSON array, so encoding needs no special handling. Decoding must reverse that everywhere a tuple could have been — a recovered key holding a `list` would be unhashable and could never equal the tuple a live call to `generate_key` produces for the same arguments — so `_decode_key` turns every JSON array, at any depth, back into a `tuple`. This can never mistake a genuine `list` argument for a `tuple` one, because such an argument was already unusable here: `generate_key`'s result must be hashable, so a live call with a `list` anywhere in its arguments would already raise `TypeError` from `key in self.cache`, before persistence enters into it. A returned value is under no such requirement, since it is never a key, so it is left exactly as `json.loads` produces it — why a `tuple` inside one survives a crash as a `list`.

```python
import json
import os
import zlib

PUT, TOUCH = "put", "touch"


def _decode_key(value: Any) -> Any:
    if isinstance(value, list):
        return tuple(_decode_key(item) for item in value)

    payload = json.dumps(body, separators=(",", ":")).encode("utf-8")
    header = len(payload).to_bytes(8, "big")
    checksum = zlib.crc32(header + payload).to_bytes(4, "big")  # NOTE: covers the header too -- see above
    return header + checksum + payload

    length = int.from_bytes(data[pos:pos + 8], "big")
    end = pos + 12 + length
    if end > len(data):
        return None                                         # cut off mid-record, or a damaged (huge) length
    payload = data[pos + 12:end]
    if zlib.crc32(data[pos:pos + 8] + payload) != int.from_bytes(data[pos + 8:pos + 12], "big"):

        self._log = open(self.path, "ab")
```

A crash between the rename and the truncation in `compact()` leaves the just-replaced log sitting next to the new snapshot; the next recovery loads the snapshot, then replays that whole, now-redundant log on top of it. That reproduces the very same state, not a different one: replaying the log twice in a row is the same as replaying it once concatenated with itself, and a full replay's final order and evicted set depend only on each key's *last* occurrence in the sequence — which falls at the same relative position in that second copy as in the log alone, even though individual records reorder the cache differently along the way. Neither `_load` nor `compact()` ever calls `func`, so at worst this wastes some parsing, never returns a wrong answer.

`__call__` costs one `fsync` beyond `Memoize`'s $O(1)$, a round trip to durable storage on every single call, hit or miss alike. `compact()` is $O(\text{capacity})$, dominated by writing out the entries currently cached, and is never called from inside `__call__`, so it never adds its own cost to a call.

### Part 3

A single lock could wrap the entire call, `func` included — correct, and the simplest thread-safe wrapper, but it serialises every call behind whichever one is running, including calls for already-cached keys and keys nobody else is touching: `func`'s own cost (a network call, a slow computation) becomes every other caller's cost too.

```python
import threading
import time


class NaiveLockedMemoize(DurableMemoize):
    """One lock around the whole call, func included -- correct, but no two calls ever overlap."""

    def __init__(self, func: Callable, capacity: int, path: str | None = None) -> None:
        super().__init__(func, capacity, path)
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

    def __call__(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        with self._lock:
            return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
```

The fix is to hold a lock only around the bookkeeping — checking the cache, appending to the log, updating the `OrderedDict` — and run `func` outside it entirely. That alone reopens a race `Memoize` never had to consider: two threads can both see a miss for the same key before either finishes computing it, so both call `func` and both insert a result — correct, since the cache still ends up valid, but wasteful, and wrong when `func`'s repeated calls are not free to duplicate (a payment, a write to another system). Avoiding that — *single-flight* — needs one more piece of shared state: which keys have a computation in progress, and a way for a later caller to wait on the first one's result instead of starting its own.

`ThreadSafeMemoize` keeps one `threading.Event` per key currently being computed, in a dict guarded by the same lock as the cache. A thread that finds its key already has one waits on it, without holding the lock, and reads the leader's result once the event fires; a thread that finds none creates one, becomes that key's leader, releases the lock, calls `func`, then reacquires the lock only to install the result, evict if `capacity` demands it, and append the durability record — waking every waiter only afterwards, so a waiter's return is exactly as durable as the leader's, though only the leader ever writes a log record.

That log append shares the leader's critical section rather than a lock of its own because the log's on-disk order is what recovery uses to reconstruct recency (a key's *last* record fixes its position), so it must agree with the order calls actually took effect in memory: a lock dedicated only to the log, acquired independently of the one serialising cache updates, could let two threads acquire the two in opposite orders — one thread's cache update lands first while its log record lands second — and recovery would then reconstruct a recency order the live cache never had. A per-key lock, created the first time each key is touched, would not remove this shared lock either: an `OrderedDict`'s recency chain is shared by every key, so protecting it still needs one lock spanning all of them (the follow-ups return to what a per-key lock would buy instead).

```python
class _InFlight:
    """Coordinates one key's in-progress computation: a thread that is not the leader waits on
    event, then reads result (or re-raises exc)."""

    __slots__ = ("event", "result", "exc")

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.event = threading.Event()
        self.result: Any = None
        self.exc: BaseException | None = None


class ThreadSafeMemoize(DurableMemoize):
    def __init__(self, func: Callable, capacity: int, path: str | None = None) -> None:
        super().__init__(func, capacity, path)
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
        self._in_flight: dict[Any, _InFlight] = {}

    def __call__(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        key = self.generate_key(*args, **kwargs)
        with self._lock:
            if key in self.cache:
                self.hits += 1
                self.cache.move_to_end(key)
                self._append(TOUCH, key)
                return self.cache[key]
            waiting = self._in_flight.get(key)
            if waiting is None:
                waiting = self._in_flight[key] = _InFlight()
                leader = True
            else:
                leader = False

        if not leader:
            waiting.event.wait()                  # NOTE: outside the lock -- other keys keep making progress
            if waiting.exc is not None:
                raise waiting.exc
            return waiting.result

        try:
            result = self.func(*args, **kwargs)    # NOTE: outside the lock -- func's own latency is not serialised
        except BaseException as exc:
            with self._lock:
                del self._in_flight[key]
            waiting.exc = exc
            waiting.event.set()
            raise

        with self._lock:
            self.misses += 1
            self._append(PUT, key, result)         # NOTE: same critical section as the cache update -- see above
            self.cache[key] = result
            if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
                self.cache.popitem(last=False)
            del self._in_flight[key]
        waiting.result = result
        waiting.event.set()                         # NOTE: only after the result is fully cached and durable
        return result
```

`__call__` is $O(1)$ expected on a hit and while waiting; a leader's own cost is `func`'s cost plus one `fsync`, paid once regardless of how many threads coalesced onto it.

### Follow-ups

- Binding arguments against `inspect.signature(func).bind(*args, **kwargs).apply_defaults()` before hashing would unify `f(1, 2)` with `f(1, b=2)`, at the cost of a slower key and a real signature for `func` — unavailable when `func` is declared only as `(*args, **kwargs)`.
- An eviction needs no explicit record: replay derives every eviction from the `PUT`/`TOUCH` history under a fixed `capacity`, exactly as `__call__` does live. It would matter without `compact()`, where such a record would mark the point before which a key's older records are safe to skip.
- Batching several pending records and `fsync`ing once every few calls or milliseconds trades durability for throughput: up to that many calls can now be lost on a crash, so "no data loss" means "at most the last unflushed batch."
- A second writer process must not race the first: serialise both with an OS advisory lock (`fcntl.flock`) held across an append and its `fsync`, or route every call through one writer process that owns the log, with the others talking to it over a queue or a socket.
- A hit's cost is dominated by its `fsync` — a millisecond-scale round trip to storage regardless of lookup cost — so that path is I/O-bound; a miss is too whenever `func` does I/O, and CPU-bound only when `func` is pure computation.
- A per-key lock would shrink contention on the single-flight decision itself, worthwhile only under many concurrently-missing keys, since that step is already $O(1)$ and touches no disk; it would not touch eviction. Removing that last lock for good instead means sharding into independent LRUs, each with its own lock and a slice of `capacity` chosen by hashing the key — the standard fix once contention on the lock, not disk I/O, is the bottleneck.
