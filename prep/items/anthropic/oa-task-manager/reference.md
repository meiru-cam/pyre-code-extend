Two points worth confirming before coding: whether a title must be unique (here it need not be — only `task_id` is guaranteed unique); and whether `update_task` should be able to change a task's `ttl` (here it cannot — expiry is fixed once at creation, and `update_task` only ever touches title and priority).

### Level 1

Every task is one mutable record in a dict keyed by `task_id`; a second counter hands out ids in call order. `_active_record` centralizes the three failure conditions every mutator and `get_task` share — unknown id, wrong owner, not active — so each of them is one lookup plus one check. `timestamp` is accepted here, even though nothing in this level reads it yet, so that every level from here on keeps the same signature; Level 3 is the first to compare it against anything.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Task:
    task_id: str
    title: str
    priority: int
    created_at: int


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._tasks: dict[str, dict] = {}   # task_id -> mutable record
        self._next_id = 1

    def add_task(self, timestamp: int, user: str, title: str, priority: int) -> str:
        task_id = f"task-{self._next_id}"
        self._next_id += 1
        self._tasks[task_id] = {"user": user, "title": title, "priority": priority,
                                 "created_at": timestamp, "completed": False}
        return task_id

    def _active_record(self, user: str, task_id: str) -> dict | None:
        rec = self._tasks.get(task_id)
        if rec is None or rec["user"] != user or rec["completed"]:
            return None
        return rec

    def update_task(self, timestamp: int, user: str, task_id: str, title: str, priority: int) -> bool:
        rec = self._active_record(user, task_id)
        if rec is None:
            return False
        rec["title"], rec["priority"] = title, priority
        return True

    def complete_task(self, timestamp: int, user: str, task_id: str) -> bool:
        rec = self._active_record(user, task_id)
        if rec is None:
            return False
        rec["completed"] = True
        return True

    def get_task(self, timestamp: int, user: str, task_id: str) -> Task | None:
        rec = self._active_record(user, task_id)
        return None if rec is None else Task(task_id, rec["title"], rec["priority"], rec["created_at"])
```

Every method is $O(1)$.

### Level 2

`get_task_list` scans every task in the instance, keeps the ones owned by `user` that are active and pass the priority filter, then sorts. The sort key is `(-priority, creation_seq)`: negating priority turns Python's ascending sort into descending order on priority, and `creation_seq` — the numeric suffix of `task_id`, i.e. the order `add_task` was called — breaks ties, because two tasks can carry the same `created_at` timestamp but never the same `task_id`.

```python
def _creation_seq(task_id: str) -> int:
    return int(task_id.rsplit("-", 1)[1])


class TaskManager(TaskManager):
    def get_task_list(self, at_timestamp: int, user: str, min_priority: int | None = None) -> list[Task]:
        matches = [(task_id, rec) for task_id, rec in self._tasks.items()
                   if rec["user"] == user and not rec["completed"]
                   and (min_priority is None or rec["priority"] >= min_priority)]
        matches.sort(key=lambda pair: (-pair[1]["priority"], _creation_seq(pair[0])))
        return [Task(task_id, rec["title"], rec["priority"], rec["created_at"]) for task_id, rec in matches]
```

Reopening `TaskManager` as its own subclass, rather than editing Level 1's block, is how the rest of this solution extends it level by level. This costs $O(T + m \log m)$, where $T$ is the number of tasks in the whole instance and $m \le T$ is the number owned by `user` that pass the filter: the scan touches every task once, and only the matches are sorted. A per-user index would drop the $T$ term; Level 4 builds one anyway; see there for the resulting improvement.

### Level 3

Level 3 adds one field to the record, `ttl` (`None` for a permanent task, otherwise the positive integer passed to `add_task`), and one more failure condition to check everywhere a task's liveness matters: `_active_record` becomes `_record`, taking the instant to check liveness at as an explicit argument instead of assuming "now". Because every caller's failure condition changes, Level 1's and Level 2's methods are overridden here, not inherited unchanged — inheriting `get_task_list`, for instance, would keep checking only `rec["completed"]` and let an expired task through.

```python
class TaskManager(TaskManager):
    def add_task(self, timestamp: int, user: str, title: str, priority: int, ttl: int | None = None) -> str:
        task_id = super().add_task(timestamp, user, title, priority)
        self._tasks[task_id]["ttl"] = ttl
        return task_id

    @staticmethod
    def _alive(rec: dict, at_timestamp: int) -> bool:
        if rec["completed"]:
            return False
        ttl = rec.get("ttl")
        return ttl is None or at_timestamp < rec["created_at"] + ttl   # NOTE: "<", not "<=" -- created_at + ttl
                                                                         #  is already expired, not the last alive instant

    def _record(self, user: str, task_id: str, at_timestamp: int) -> dict | None:
        rec = self._tasks.get(task_id)
        if rec is None or rec["user"] != user or not self._alive(rec, at_timestamp):
            return None
        return rec

    def update_task(self, timestamp: int, user: str, task_id: str, title: str, priority: int) -> bool:
        rec = self._record(user, task_id, timestamp)
        if rec is None:
            return False
        rec["title"], rec["priority"] = title, priority
        return True

    def complete_task(self, timestamp: int, user: str, task_id: str) -> bool:
        rec = self._record(user, task_id, timestamp)
        if rec is None:
            return False
        rec["completed"] = True
        return True

    def get_task(self, timestamp: int, user: str, task_id: str) -> Task | None:
        rec = self._record(user, task_id, timestamp)
        return None if rec is None else Task(task_id, rec["title"], rec["priority"], rec["created_at"])

    def get_task_list(self, at_timestamp: int, user: str, min_priority: int | None = None) -> list[Task]:
        matches = [(task_id, rec) for task_id, rec in self._tasks.items()
                   if rec["user"] == user and self._alive(rec, at_timestamp)
                   and (min_priority is None or rec["priority"] >= min_priority)]
        matches.sort(key=lambda pair: (-pair[1]["priority"], _creation_seq(pair[0])))
        return [Task(task_id, rec["title"], rec["priority"], rec["created_at"]) for task_id, rec in matches]
```

This is lazy expiry: an expired task is never swept out on a timer or on the next write, only skipped the next time something reads it. It is enough here because nothing in this class needs to know how many tasks exist without reading them first, so the only thing an eager sweep would buy is memory, and an expired record here is a handful of scalar fields, not something worth a background thread or a check squeezed into every mutator just to reclaim early. Every method keeps Level 1's and Level 2's complexity: $O(1)$ for the mutators, $O(T + m \log m)$ for `get_task_list`.

### Level 4

Levels 1 through 3 keep exactly one mutable record per task, overwritten in place by every `update_task` or `complete_task` call — ideal for a "now" query, since there is never more than one answer to look up, but useless for a past one: once a later call has overwritten a field, nothing is left to say what it held before. Level 4 needs that, so the storage changes from one current record per task to that task's whole version history: every `(timestamp, title, priority)` it has ever had, in call order, plus the one timestamp it was completed at, if any (at most one, since `complete_task` already fails once a task is not active, so it can never succeed twice on the same task). Both are append-only. Every `add_task`, `update_task`, and `complete_task` call, across the whole instance, carries a timestamp no smaller than the one before it, so one task's own events — a subsequence of that global sequence — arrive already sorted by timestamp; recording one is always an append to the end of a list, never an insertion into its middle.

```python
from bisect import bisect_right


@dataclass
class _History:

    ttl: int | None
    created_at: int
    timestamps: list[int]     # version timestamps, non-decreasing, bisected against at_timestamp

    def _alive_at(self, hist: _History, at_timestamp: int) -> bool:

            return False
        if hist.completed_at is not None and hist.completed_at <= at_timestamp:

    def get_task_list(self, at_timestamp: int, user: str, min_priority: int | None = None) -> list[Task]:
        out = []

            hist = self._history[task_id]

                continue                                   #  update or completion must never leak into this snapshot
            title, priority = self._version_at(hist, at_timestamp)
            if min_priority is not None and priority < min_priority:
                continue
            out.append((priority, _creation_seq(task_id), task_id, title))

                for priority, _, task_id, title in out]
```

`_version_at` is the bisect step: `bisect_right` finds the insertion point just past every entry equal to `at_timestamp`, so subtracting `1` lands on the last entry with `timestamp <= at_timestamp` — the most recent call visible from `at_timestamp`, including one made at exactly `at_timestamp` itself. `_alive_at` then combines three independent checks — a version must exist yet (`bisect` returns nothing only if `at_timestamp` is before the task's `created_at`), it must not carry a completion at or before `at_timestamp`, and it must not have expired by `at_timestamp` — and none of the three ever inspects a version recorded after `at_timestamp`, which is exactly why a query into the past cannot see an edit that has not "happened yet" from that moment's point of view. `add_task` now also fills `_by_user`, a per-user list of task ids in creation order, which is what removes Level 2's $T$ term: `get_task_list` visits only tasks `user` has ever owned.

`update_task` and `complete_task` stay $O(1)$: each appends to the end of one task's own list, never searching it, since that task's latest event is always the one most recently appended. `get_task` is $O(\log v)$ in the number of versions `task_id` has accumulated — one `bisect`. `get_task_list` is $O(k (\log v + \log k))$, where $k$ is the number of tasks `user` has ever created (active or not — every one of them has to be checked) and $v$ bounds any one task's version count: one `bisect` per task, plus sorting the survivors.

The alternative — keep one global, append-only log of every `add_task`/`update_task`/`complete_task` call ever made, and answer a query by replaying the log events with `timestamp <= at_timestamp` from scratch, in call order, rebuilding a fresh dict of current records exactly the way Levels 1-3 would have looked with only that prefix of calls — is also correct, and needs no per-task bisect at all. But it costs $O(C)$ per query, where $C$ is the *total* number of mutating calls made to the whole instance so far, across every user: a system with many active users pays for all of them on every single-user query. The version-history approach only ever walks work proportional to the one user being asked about, at the cost of $O(1)$ extra space per version to keep it around indefinitely; log replay uses the same $O(C)$ space for the log but no per-task index, and is the simpler of the two to get right first, which is why it is also what the checks below use as an independent way to verify the fast version.

### Follow-ups

- A method that answers one task's whole edit history, not just its state at one instant, is a slice of `timestamps`/`titles`/`priorities` between two `bisect` calls, not a fresh scan.
- `get_task` and the mutators never actually require `at_timestamp`/`timestamp` to be the latest moment seen — `_record` and `_version_at` work at any instant. Only `get_task_list`'s statement promises this, but the same machinery answers a historical `get_task` correctly too, for free.
- Version history grows without bound: a task updated every day for a year carries 365 entries forever. If only, say, the last 90 days of look-back is ever needed, versions older than that (for a task with at least one newer one) can be dropped once no future query can name a timestamp before them — an assumption that a system answering *arbitrary* past queries, as this one does, cannot make.
- An explicit, named-snapshot design — a `backup(timestamp)` call that freezes the current state, and a `restore` that jumps back to the nearest one made — trades this level's "ask about any instant, always" for "ask only about instants someone explicitly saved", in exchange for $O(1)$ extra bookkeeping per write instead of an ever-growing history.
- Making this thread-safe needs a lock around each task's whole read-check-append sequence in `update_task`/`complete_task`, not just around the list appends themselves: two threads racing to update the same task could otherwise both read it as active before either one appends.
