Worth confirming up front, because reasonable designs differ on them: whether a hold changes the balance figure itself or only what a later withdrawal or transfer may take (here, only the latter — a hold is bookkeeping alongside the balance, not a change to it); and whether an account's outgoing total should count a transfer at the moment it starts or only once it is accepted (here, at the moment it starts, win or lose, since that is the only point every transfer is guaranteed to reach).

### Level 1

An account is a small object carrying its balance and, from the timestamp it was created, the list of `(timestamp, balance)` pairs `get_balance` will need from Level 4 on; recording this from Level 1 costs nothing and needs no change later. `_apply` is the one place a balance actually changes, so every later level's writes go through it too. `_available`, used by `withdraw` here and by `transfer` from Level 3 on, already has its final form: until `transfer` exists, no account ever gets an entry in `_holds`, so it simply returns the balance.

```python
class _Account:
    def __init__(self, created_at: int):
        self.balance = 0
        self.outgoing_total = 0
        self.events: list[tuple[int, int]] = [(created_at, 0)]   # (timestamp, balance) after each change


class Bank:
    TRANSFER_WINDOW = 1_000

    def __init__(self):
        self._live: dict[str, _Account] = {}
        self._transfers: dict[str, "_Transfer"] = {}
        self._holds: dict[str, list[str]] = {}      # account_id -> ids of transfers it is the source of
        self._incoming: dict[str, list[str]] = {}    # account_id -> ids of transfers it is the target of
        self._transfer_seq = 0

    def create_account(self, timestamp: int, account_id: str) -> bool:
        if account_id in self._live:
            return False
        self._live[account_id] = _Account(timestamp)   # NOTE: a fresh object -- see Level 4
        return True

    def deposit(self, timestamp: int, account_id: str, amount: int) -> int | None:
        account = self._live.get(account_id)
        return None if account is None else self._apply(account, timestamp, amount)

    def withdraw(self, timestamp: int, account_id: str, amount: int) -> int | None:
        account = self._live.get(account_id)
        if account is None or amount > self._available(account_id, timestamp):
            return None
        account.outgoing_total += amount
        return self._apply(account, timestamp, -amount)

    def _apply(self, account: _Account, timestamp: int, delta: int) -> int:
        account.balance += delta
        account.events.append((timestamp, account.balance))
        return account.balance

    def _available(self, account_id: str, timestamp: int) -> int:
        account = self._live[account_id]
        held = sum(self._transfers[tid].amount for tid in self._holds.get(account_id, [])
                   if not self._transfers[tid].accepted
                   and timestamp <= self._transfers[tid].created_at + self.TRANSFER_WINDOW)
        return account.balance - held   # NOTE: a hold never touches balance -- only what may be taken from it
```

Each method is $O(1)$, aside from `_available`'s scan of `account_id`'s own transfers, which only ever holds entries from Level 3 on.

### Level 2

`top_spenders` is one sort over the live accounts, by a key that negates the outgoing total (so the largest sorts first) and keeps `account_id` itself as the tie-break, ascending, since it is not negated.

```python
def top_spenders(self, timestamp: int, n: int) -> list[str]:
    ranked = sorted(self._live.items(), key=lambda item: (-item[1].outgoing_total, item[0]))
    return [f"{account_id}({account.outgoing_total})" for account_id, account in ranked[:n]]


Bank.top_spenders = top_spenders
```

$O(k \log k)$ in the number of live accounts $k$; slicing to $n$ after a full sort costs nothing extra worth a separate data structure at this scale.

### Level 3

A `_Transfer` records its source, target, amount, creation timestamp and whether it has been accepted; nothing else needs to be stored, because "expired" is never written down anywhere — `_available` and `accept_transfer` both recompute it from `created_at` and their own call's `timestamp` every time they need it. `transfer` validates against `_available` (already correct, from Level 1) and files the new transfer under both its source (for `_available`) and its target (for `merge_accounts`, in Level 4).

```python
class _Transfer:
    def __init__(self, transfer_id: str, source_id: str, target_id: str, amount: int, created_at: int):
        self.id = transfer_id
        self.source_id = source_id
        self.target_id = target_id
        self.amount = amount
        self.created_at = created_at
        self.accepted = False


def transfer(self, timestamp: int, source_id: str, target_id: str, amount: int) -> str | None:
    if (source_id == target_id or source_id not in self._live or target_id not in self._live
            or amount > self._available(source_id, timestamp)):
        return None
    self._transfer_seq += 1
    transfer_id = f"transfer{self._transfer_seq}"
    self._transfers[transfer_id] = _Transfer(transfer_id, source_id, target_id, amount, timestamp)
    self._holds.setdefault(source_id, []).append(transfer_id)
    self._incoming.setdefault(target_id, []).append(transfer_id)
    return transfer_id


def accept_transfer(self, timestamp: int, account_id: str, transfer_id: str) -> bool:
    t = self._transfers.get(transfer_id)
    if (t is None or t.accepted or t.target_id != account_id
            or timestamp > t.created_at + self.TRANSFER_WINDOW):
        return False                     # NOTE: expiry is a plain comparison, re-checked on every call --
    t.accepted = True                    # nothing is swept or scheduled ahead of time
    self._apply(self._live[t.source_id], timestamp, -t.amount)
    self._apply(self._live[t.target_id], timestamp, t.amount)
    return True


Bank.transfer = transfer
Bank.accept_transfer = accept_transfer
```

`transfer` and `accept_transfer` are both $O(1)$ beyond the `_available` scan; `_available` is $O(h)$ in the number of transfers ever started from that account, since a completed or expired one is left in `_holds` rather than removed (cheap here, since an OA-scale call sequence never makes $h$ large enough for the scan to matter; a long-lived account would instead prune `_holds` opportunistically).

### Level 4

`merge_accounts` moves three things from `b` to `a`: the balance (one `_apply`, dated to the merge itself), the outgoing total (a plain add), and every pending transfer that names `b`, in both directions — `_holds[b]` (where `b` is the source) and `_incoming[b]` (where `b` is the target) are each folded into `a`'s own list, and the `_Transfer` objects themselves are repointed so that a later `accept_transfer` or a further merge sees `a`, not the now-dead `b`. Deleting `b` from `_live` is what makes it stop being live; the next `create_account` call for `b`, whenever it comes, builds a brand new `_Account`, so its `events` list starts fresh at its own creation timestamp — it shares nothing with the generation that was merged away, which is exactly what makes `get_balance` correct for a reused id. `get_balance` looks up the live account, if any, and binary-searches its `events` for the last entry at or before `time_at`.

```python
import bisect


def merge_accounts(self, timestamp: int, a: str, b: str) -> bool:
    if a == b or a not in self._live or b not in self._live:
        return False
    acc_a, acc_b = self._live[a], self._live[b]
    self._apply(acc_a, timestamp, acc_b.balance)
    acc_a.outgoing_total += acc_b.outgoing_total
    for tid in self._holds.pop(b, []):              # NOTE: both directions -- b as source ...
        self._transfers[tid].source_id = a
        self._holds.setdefault(a, []).append(tid)
    for tid in self._incoming.pop(b, []):            # ... and b as target
        self._transfers[tid].target_id = a
        self._incoming.setdefault(a, []).append(tid)
    del self._live[b]                                # NOTE: a later create_account(b) builds a fresh _Account --
    return True                                       # nothing here keeps that new object linked to this one


def get_balance(self, timestamp: int, account_id: str, time_at: int) -> int | None:
    account = self._live.get(account_id)
    if account is None:
        return None
    i = bisect.bisect_right(account.events, time_at, key=lambda e: e[0]) - 1
    return account.events[i][1] if i >= 0 else None


Bank.merge_accounts = merge_accounts
Bank.get_balance = get_balance
```

`merge_accounts` is $O(p)$ in the number of transfers it reassigns; `get_balance` is $O(\log e)$ in the number of balance-changing events its account's current generation has recorded.

### Follow-ups

- Undoing a merge: `merge_accounts` folds `b`'s balance into `a` as a single credit and deletes `b` outright, so nothing records which of `a`'s transfers came from `b`, or what `a`'s balance was the instant before. A reversible merge would need to keep that snapshot until it is safe to discard.
- Concurrent calls: every method above reads and writes `_live`, `_holds` and `_incoming` without a lock, so two threads calling `transfer` on the same source at once could both read the same `_available` figure before either commits its hold. A per-account lock held for the duration of `withdraw`, `transfer` and `accept_transfer` serializes exactly the calls that touch shared state, without blocking calls on unrelated accounts.
- An account with a very long transfer history: `_available` scans every transfer that account has ever started, including ones long since accepted or expired. Dropping a transfer's id from `_holds` the moment it is accepted, and lazily whenever `_available` notices one has expired, keeps the scan bounded by the number of transfers currently pending instead of ever started.
- A configurable expiry window: nothing about the solution depends on the exact figure $1{,}000$, so `TRANSFER_WINDOW` could become a constructor argument, or a per-transfer one passed to `transfer` itself, without touching the expiry logic.
