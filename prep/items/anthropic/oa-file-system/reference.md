Worth confirming with the interviewer up front: whether `mkdir` behaves like `mkdir -p`, creating missing parent directories, rather than requiring the parent to already exist (assumed here); and whether overwriting an existing directory with `mv`/`cp` replaces it outright or merges into it (replacement is assumed here, since a merge needs its own conflict rule for every name that exists on both sides).

### Level 1

Every directory and file is a node of a tree kept in memory: an internal `_Dir` holds a `dict` from child name to child node, and an internal `_File` holds `content` and, from Level 3 on, `owner`. The root is one `_Dir` that is never itself stored under a name. `_split` turns a path into its list of components, or `None` if the path is invalid.

Two helpers carry every level from here on. `_precheck` walks a list of components read-only and reports whether an existing component blocks the walk (some proper prefix of the path is already a file) and, if not, whatever sits at the full path (`None` if nothing does). `_materialize` walks the same components, creating any missing directory as it goes, and only ever runs after a `_precheck` has confirmed nothing along the way is a file. This ordering makes every method below atomic — a failed call leaves no trace — because once `_precheck` finds a component *missing*, every component after it is missing too (a directory `_materialize` just created starts out empty), so a conflict can only surface at the *first* point the requested path diverges from what already exists, before anything is created.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
import copy


class _File:
    __slots__ = ("content", "owner")

    def __init__(self, content: str, owner: str):
        self.content = content
        self.owner = owner


class _Dir:
    __slots__ = ("children",)

    def __init__(self):
        self.children: dict[str, "_Dir | _File"] = {}


def _split(path: str) -> list[str] | None:
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path.startswith("/"):
        return None
    parts = [seg for seg in path.split("/") if seg != ""]   # NOTE: collapses repeated "/" and a trailing "/"
    if any(seg in (".", "..") for seg in parts):
        return None
    return parts


class FileSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self._root = _Dir()
        self._users: dict[str, dict] = {}        # user_id -> {"capacity": int, "used": int} -- Level 3

    def _precheck(self, comps: list[str]):
        node = self._root
        for c in comps:
            if not isinstance(node, _Dir):
                return "blocked", None
            nxt = node.children.get(c)
            if nxt is None:
                return "ok", None           # NOTE: nothing under an absent directory can exist either
            node = nxt
        return "ok", node

    def _materialize(self, comps: list[str]) -> "_Dir":
        node = self._root
        for c in comps:
            if c not in node.children:
                node.children[c] = _Dir()
            node = node.children[c]
        return node

    def _resolve(self, comps: list[str]):
        status, node = self._precheck(comps)
        return node if status == "ok" else None

    def mkdir(self, path: str) -> bool:
        comps = _split(path)
        if comps is None:
            return False
        status, existing = self._precheck(comps)
        if status == "blocked" or isinstance(existing, _File):
            return False
        self._materialize(comps)
        return True

    def write(self, path: str, content: str) -> bool:
        comps = _split(path)
        if comps is None or not comps:          # NOTE: not comps -- "/" itself is never a file
            return False
        status, existing = self._precheck(comps)
        if status == "blocked" or isinstance(existing, _Dir):
            return False
        parent = self._materialize(comps[:-1])
        parent.children[comps[-1]] = _File(content, "admin")
        return True

    def read(self, path: str) -> str | None:
        comps = _split(path)
        node = self._resolve(comps) if comps is not None else None
        return node.content if isinstance(node, _File) else None

    def ls(self, path: str) -> list[str] | None:
        comps = _split(path)
        node = self._resolve(comps) if comps is not None else None
        return sorted(node.children) if isinstance(node, _Dir) else None
```

`mkdir`, `write`, `read` and `ls` are all $O(d)$ in the depth $d$ of `path`, aside from `ls`'s $O(k \log k)$ sort of its $k$ children.

### Level 2

`mv` and `cp` share one helper, `_move_or_copy`, differing only in whether `src` survives. `_on_same_chain` catches every illegal pairing in one check: one component list is a prefix of the other — true when they are equal, when `dst` sits inside `src`'s subtree, and, easy to miss, when `dst` is an *ancestor* of `src`. Skipping that last case would let `mv("/a/b", "/a")` through: placing the result at `/a` would first discard `/a`'s old subtree, which contains `/a/b` itself, freeing quota (from Level 3 on) for bytes that only moved, not vanished.

Placement reuses `_precheck` and `_materialize` exactly as Level 1 does: an existing `dst` must be the same kind as `src`, or the call is rejected before anything is touched, and `mv` only removes `src` once that destination slot is confirmed clear.

```python
def _deepcopy(node):
    if isinstance(node, _File):
        return _File(node.content, node.owner)
    new = _Dir()
    for k, v in node.children.items():
        new.children[k] = _deepcopy(v)
    return new


def _on_same_chain(a: list[str], b: list[str]) -> bool:
    """True if a is a prefix of b, or b is a prefix of a (equal counts as both)."""
    shorter, longer = (a, b) if len(a) <= len(b) else (b, a)
    return longer[:len(shorter)] == shorter


def _size_of(node) -> int:
    if isinstance(node, _File):
        return len(node.content)
    return sum(_size_of(c) for c in node.children.values())


def size(self, path: str) -> int | None:
    comps = _split(path)
    node = self._resolve(comps) if comps is not None else None
    return None if node is None else _size_of(node)


def rm(self, path: str) -> bool:
    comps = _split(path)
    if comps is None or not comps:
        return False
    parent = self._resolve(comps[:-1])
    if not isinstance(parent, _Dir) or comps[-1] not in parent.children:
        return False
    del parent.children[comps[-1]]
    return True


def _move_or_copy(self, src: str, dst: str, remove_src: bool) -> bool:
    src_comps, dst_comps = _split(src), _split(dst)
    if src_comps is None or not src_comps or dst_comps is None or not dst_comps:
        return False
    src_node = self._resolve(src_comps)
    if src_node is None or _on_same_chain(src_comps, dst_comps):
        return False                        # NOTE: covers dst == src, dst inside src, AND src inside dst
    status, existing = self._precheck(dst_comps)
    if status == "blocked" or (existing is not None and type(existing) is not type(src_node)):
        return False                        # NOTE: file/directory type mismatch at an existing destination
    new_node = src_node if remove_src else _deepcopy(src_node)
    parent = self._materialize(dst_comps[:-1])   # -- validated: safe to mutate from here on --
    if remove_src:
        src_parent = self._resolve(src_comps[:-1])
        del src_parent.children[src_comps[-1]]
    parent.children[dst_comps[-1]] = new_node
    return True


def mv(self, src: str, dst: str) -> bool:
    return self._move_or_copy(src, dst, remove_src=True)


def cp(self, src: str, dst: str) -> bool:
    return self._move_or_copy(src, dst, remove_src=False)


FileSystem.size = size
FileSystem.rm = rm
FileSystem._move_or_copy = _move_or_copy
FileSystem.mv = mv
FileSystem.cp = cp
```

`rm` and `size` are $O(n)$ in the size $n$ of the subtree they touch; `_move_or_copy` is $O(n)$ for `cp` (it copies the subtree) and $O(d)$ for `mv` (it only relinks one node), plus $O(n)$ to delete an overwritten destination in either case.

### Level 3

Level 3 gives every file an `owner` and every user a capacity; `write` and `_move_or_copy` are replaced by versions that layer ownership and quota checks onto the same tree walk. `write` checks only the one file it touches; `mv` and `cp` can touch a whole subtree, so they first total its sizes per owner with `_files_by_owner`.

The key simplification is that **`mv` never needs a capacity check**. Relocating a file changes no owner's total: its bytes leave one path already counted against their owner and arrive at another, still counted exactly once. The only capacity-relevant effect a directory-replacing `mv` can have is discarding whatever used to be at `dst`, which only frees capacity, never spends it. `cp`, by contrast, duplicates bytes — the source keeps its copy and the destination gets a new one — so it is the only one of the two that a full quota can block.

Ownership is checked the same way for both: overwriting a file always requires its current owner to equal the incoming file's owner, a plain equality check on the entry `_precheck` already looked up. `rm` needs its own small addition below: freeing an owner's quota is bookkeeping that `write`, `mv` and `cp` already do on an overwrite, and `rm` has no overwrite to attach it to.

```python
def _files_by_owner(node) -> dict:
    totals: dict[str, int] = {}
    stack = [node]
    while stack:
        n = stack.pop()
        if isinstance(n, _File):
            totals[n.owner] = totals.get(n.owner, 0) + len(n.content)
        else:
            stack.extend(n.children.values())
    return totals

    return deleted


FileSystem.add_user = add_user
FileSystem.write = write
FileSystem.rm = rm
FileSystem._move_or_copy = _move_or_copy
FileSystem.update_capacity = update_capacity
```

`update_capacity` is $O(n)$ to scan the tree for the user's files plus $O(k \log k)$ to sort the $k$ found; every other Level 3 method keeps the complexity of the Level 1/2 method it replaces.

### Level 4

Level 4 changes no existing method: `snapshot` and `restore` only add one new piece of state, a `dict` of saved `(root, users)` pairs. `_deepcopy`, already written for `cp`, is reused for the tree; `copy.deepcopy` handles the flat `_users` dict. Both directions copy: `snapshot` copies out of the live tree so later writes cannot reach a saved snapshot, and `restore` copies out of the saved snapshot so mutating the restored tree, or restoring the same id again, cannot reach back into the saved copy.

```python
def snapshot(self, snapshot_id: str) -> bool:
    if not hasattr(self, "_snapshots"):
        self._snapshots = {}
    if snapshot_id in self._snapshots:
        return False
    self._snapshots[snapshot_id] = (_deepcopy(self._root), copy.deepcopy(self._users))
    return True


def restore(self, snapshot_id: str) -> bool:
    if not hasattr(self, "_snapshots") or snapshot_id not in self._snapshots:
        return False
    root, users = self._snapshots[snapshot_id]
    self._root = _deepcopy(root)            # NOTE: copy out -- restoring twice must not share state either
    self._users = copy.deepcopy(users)
    return True


FileSystem.snapshot = snapshot
FileSystem.restore = restore
```

`snapshot` and `restore` are both $O(n)$ in the size of the tree.

### Follow-ups

- No `chown` is provided: an owner is fixed once a file is created, since every overwrite rule above assumes it. Adding one means deciding whether it moves quota between owners atomically, and whether it may exceed the new owner's capacity.
- `update_capacity`'s eviction scans the whole tree for one user's files. A `dict[user_id, set[node]]` index, kept current by every method that creates, moves, or deletes a file, would turn that scan into a direct lookup, at the cost of maintaining the index everywhere ownership changes.
- Snapshots are $O(n)$ in both time and space per call. A copy-on-write tree — sharing unchanged subtrees between a snapshot and the live tree, copying a node only the first time something under it changes — makes `snapshot` itself $O(1)$, at the cost of every write potentially copying an ancestor chain instead of mutating in place.
- `size` walks a directory's whole subtree on every call. Caching a running total per directory, kept current by every mutating method under it, makes it $O(1)$ at the cost of more bookkeeping on every write, move, copy, and delete.
- A real file system also tracks timestamps and per-user read/write/execute permissions; `owner` alone already answers every rule this problem asks for, so neither is in scope here.
