Two points are worth confirming before coding. Whether a dataset really does wrap around indefinitely rather than raising once exhausted — assumed yes, exactly as `DataRegistry` states, which is also what makes the batcher itself never need to know a dataset's length. And whether `weights` is fixed for the life of one `DataBatcher` — assumed yes below; a run that needs different weights partway through constructs a new batcher with them and loads the old one's `state_dict()` into it.

### Part 1

Each dataset needs its own read position, since the $K$ datasets are consumed independently and at different rates; a `dict` keyed by name holds these offsets, and a second `dict` holds one live iterator per dataset, opened lazily, so that a dataset that `next_batch()` never draws from is never opened at all. Reopening `get_iterator` on every single call would also work — the registry promises it is fast — but keeping the iterator alive between calls avoids paying that cost on every one of `batch_size` slots in Part 3, and it is no harder to write.

```python
class DataBatcher:
    def __init__(self, registry: "DataRegistry", weights: dict[str, int], batch_size: int) -> None:
        if not weights or any(w <= 0 for w in weights.values()):
            raise ValueError("weights must be a non-empty mapping of positive integers")
        if batch_size <= 0:
            raise ValueError("batch_size must be positive")
        self._registry = registry
        self._names = sorted(weights)                      # NOTE: fixed alphabetical order, used everywhere
        self._weights = dict(weights)
        self._total_weight = sum(weights.values())
        self._batch_size = batch_size
        self._offsets = {name: 0 for name in self._names}  # examples drawn so far, per dataset
        self._iters: dict = {}                              # live iterators, opened lazily, never replayed

    def _iterator_for(self, name: str):
        it = self._iters.get(name)
        if it is None:                                       # NOTE: opened once per dataset, at its offset
            it = self._registry.get_iterator(name, self._offsets[name])
            self._iters[name] = it
        return it

    def _take(self, name: str, count: int) -> list:
        it = self._iterator_for(name)
        items = [next(it) for _ in range(count)]
        self._offsets[name] += count
        return items

    def next_batch(self) -> list:
        batch = []
        for name in self._names:
            quota = self._batch_size * self._weights[name] // self._total_weight
            batch.extend(self._take(name, quota))
        return batch
```

`next_batch()` does $O(\mathrm{batch\_size})$ work: `_take` never iterates further than the examples it actually returns, and opening an iterator is assumed $O(1)$. The batcher's own state is $O(K)$, two small dicts, regardless of how many batches have been produced.

### Part 2

The saved state is the `_offsets` dict alone: two things that might look like state are deliberately left out of it. The live iterators are not serializable in the first place — a generator cannot be written to JSON, or even copied — and there is nothing they would add to the state besides the same integer offset `get_iterator` already accepts; keeping them out is what makes `state_dict()` $O(K)$ instead of growing with every example produced. `weights` and `batch_size` are also left out, because they are constructor arguments of the batcher being resumed into, not facts about *where* it has reached; a resumed batcher is already constructed with them before `load_state_dict` is called.

```python
class DataBatcher(DataBatcher):
    def state_dict(self) -> dict:
        return {"offsets": dict(self._offsets)}             # NOTE: a copy -- callers may hold on to this

    def load_state_dict(self, state: dict) -> None:
        self._offsets = dict(state["offsets"])
        self._iters = {}          # NOTE: dropped, not replayed -- reopened lazily at the restored offsets
```

Reopening lazily rather than immediately inside `load_state_dict` means restoring itself never calls `get_iterator`: the cost lands on whichever dataset `next_batch()` actually asks for next, once per dataset it touches, each call landing directly on the saved offset — $O(1)$ per dataset touched, never $O(n)$ in how many examples came before it, satisfying Part 2's requirement without any special-casing.

### Part 3

**Deterministic.** Track, for each dataset $d_k$, its ratio $p_k(n) = \mathrm{count}_k(n) / w_k$ — the count normalized by weight — and choose whichever dataset currently has the smallest ratio, ties broken by the alphabetically smaller name. Comparing $p_i(n)$ and $p_j(n)$ by cross-multiplying $\mathrm{count}_i(n) \cdot w_j$ against $\mathrm{count}_j(n) \cdot w_i$ keeps the comparison exact: these are small integers, but float division could still round two mathematically equal ratios to two different neighbouring floats and break a tie the wrong way.

**Lemma.** For any two datasets $d_i, d_j$ and every $n \ge 0$, $\lvert p_i(n) - p_j(n) \rvert \le \max(1/w_i,\, 1/w_j)$.

*Proof.* Look only at the subsequence of choices that land on $d_i$ or $d_j$; every other choice leaves both ratios unchanged. Whenever a choice in this subsequence lands on, say, $d_i$, it is because $d_i$'s ratio was the smallest among *all* $K$ datasets at that moment, in particular no larger than $d_j$'s — so restricted to this subsequence, the rule is exactly "advance whichever of $d_i$, $d_j$ currently has the smaller-or-tied ratio, by $1/w_i$ or $1/w_j$ respectively", and the other $K - 2$ datasets play no part in it. Induct on the length of this subsequence. It starts at length 0 with both ratios 0, difference 0. Suppose the bound holds and, say, $d_i$'s ratio is the smaller-or-tied one, so it is chosen next: with $M = \max(1/w_i, 1/w_j)$ and $g$ the gap $p_j(n) - p_i(n)$ just before this choice, the hypothesis gives $0 \le g \le M$. Afterward the gap is $g - 1/w_i$, which lies in $[-1/w_i,\ M - 1/w_i] \subseteq [-M, M]$ since $1/w_i \le M$. $\blacksquare$

**Corollary.** For every $k$ and every $n$, $\lvert \mathrm{count}_k(n) - n w_k / W \rvert \le 1 + K$.

*Proof.* Since $n = \sum_j \mathrm{count}_j(n) = \sum_j w_j\, p_j(n)$, dividing by $W$ writes $n / W$ as a weighted average of the $p_j(n)$ with weights $w_j / W$ summing to 1, so

```math
p_k(n) - \frac{n}{W} = \sum_{j=1}^{K} \frac{w_j}{W}\bigl(p_k(n) - p_j(n)\bigr).
```

By the Lemma, $\lvert p_k(n) - p_j(n) \rvert \le \max(1/w_k, 1/w_j) \le 1/w_k + 1/w_j$, so

```math
\left\lvert p_k(n) - \frac{n}{W} \right\rvert
  \le \sum_{j=1}^{K} \frac{w_j}{W}\left(\frac{1}{w_k} + \frac{1}{w_j}\right)
  = \frac{1}{w_k}\underbrace{\sum_j \frac{w_j}{W}}_{=\,1} + \underbrace{\sum_j \frac{1}{W}}_{=\,K/W}
  = \frac{1}{w_k} + \frac{K}{W}.
```

Multiplying by $w_k$ gives $\lvert \mathrm{count}_k(n) - n w_k / W \rvert = w_k \lvert p_k(n) - n/W \rvert \le 1 + K w_k / W \le 1 + K$, since $w_k \le W$. $\blacksquare$

The bound is loose in practice: across the many random weight sets and thousands of slots exercised by the checks below, the worst deviation ever observed is under 2, regardless of $K$.

    def __init__(self, registry: "DataRegistry", weights: dict[str, int], batch_size: int,
                 allocation: str = "deterministic", seed: int = 0) -> None:
        if allocation not in ("deterministic", "stochastic"):
            raise ValueError(f"unknown allocation {allocation!r}")
        super().__init__(registry, weights, batch_size)

        self._prefix: list[int] = []          # cumulative weight, same alphabetical order as self._names

            running += self._weights[name]
            self._prefix.append(running)
        self._rng = random.Random(seed)

    def next_batch(self) -> list:
        if self._batch_size % self._total_weight == 0:
            return super().next_batch()                        # NOTE: Part 1's exact rule, unchanged
        pick = self._pick_deterministic if self._allocation == "deterministic" else self._pick_stochastic
        batch = []
        for _ in range(self._batch_size):
            batch.extend(self._take(pick(), 1))
        return batch

    def _pick_deterministic(self) -> str:
        best = self._names[0]
        for name in self._names[1:]:
            # count[name] / weights[name] < count[best] / weights[best], compared by cross-multiplying
            lhs = self._offsets[name] * self._weights[best]
            rhs = self._offsets[best] * self._weights[name]
            if lhs < rhs or (lhs == rhs and name < best):
                best = name
        return best

    def _pick_stochastic(self) -> str:
        draw = self._rng.randrange(self._total_weight)   # NOTE: an int in [0, W) -- no float edge case
        return self._names[bisect_right(self._prefix, draw)]

    def state_dict(self) -> dict:
        state = super().state_dict()
        if self._allocation == "stochastic":
            version, ints, gauss = self._rng.getstate()
            state["rng_state"] = [version, list(ints), gauss]    # NOTE: tuple -> list, so json.dumps works
        return state

    def load_state_dict(self, state: dict) -> None:
        super().load_state_dict(state)
        if self._allocation == "stochastic" and "rng_state" in state:
            version, ints, gauss = state["rng_state"]
            self._rng.setstate((version, tuple(ints), gauss))
```

The two allocations trade off differently. The deterministic rule has no variance at all — the Corollary bounds its worst case, not just its average case — and its state is the same integer offsets Part 2 already saves; nothing about it depends on when it happens to be checkpointed. Its ties are also broken the same way every time, so on a run of tied ratios (equal or rationally related weights) the same dataset wins every time that exact tie recurs, making the within-batch pattern itself fixed across epochs of otherwise-identical data. The stochastic rule is unbiased — $d_k$'s expected count after $n$ draws is exactly $n w_k / W$ — but its actual count is a sum of $n$ dependent random draws and so has real variance around that expectation, with nothing bounding one run's deviation the way the Corollary does. That randomness must itself be reproducible to be checkpointable: the `random.Random` object has already advanced by the time a checkpoint is taken, so `state_dict()` has to capture its *current* state, not the original `seed` — resuming from `seed` alone would replay draws already made and repeat batches already produced instead of continuing past them.

Choosing a dataset costs $O(K)$ per slot for the deterministic scan (or $O(\log K)$ with a heap keyed by ratio, worthwhile once $K$ is large) against $O(\log K)$ per slot for the stochastic binary search; `state_dict()` stays $O(K)$ either way, plus a fixed, small amount of extra state for the generator in the stochastic case.

### Follow-ups

- A dataset shorter than its quota within one batch: wraparound means it simply repeats inside that batch — the registry does this invisibly to `DataBatcher`, which never learns a dataset's length. If repeats within a single batch are unacceptable, `get_iterator` would have to raise once exhausted instead of wrapping, and `next_batch()` would then have to shrink that batch or fail outright: a change to the environment's contract, not something `DataBatcher` can fix by itself.
- Weights changing mid-training: construct a new `DataBatcher` with the new `weights` and load the old one's `state_dict()` into it — the state is only per-dataset offsets, never tied to any particular weights. Part 3's deterministic rule then measures every ratio against the *new* weights from that point on, so a dataset whose weight just increased looks artificially far behind and gets a transient run of extra picks to catch up; the Corollary's bound still applies, now anchored at $n = 0$ from the moment of the change rather than from the batcher's original construction.
- Sharding across data-parallel ranks without overlap: give rank $r$ of $R$ its own slice of every dataset's offset range at construction — for a dataset of length $L$, offsets $\bigl[\, r \lfloor L/R \rfloor,\ (r+1)\lfloor L/R \rfloor \,\bigr)$ — and wrap within that slice's own length instead of $L$. Ranks then never call `get_iterator` with an offset another rank will also use, at the cost of each rank cycling back to its own start after a slightly different number of examples when $R$ does not divide $L$ evenly.
- Before deploying: differential-test `next_batch()` against a brute force on many random `(weights, batch_size)` pairs for Part 1, and against the Corollary's bound for Part 3; pause and resume at every batch boundary of a long run under both allocations and diff against an uninterrupted run; round-trip `state_dict()` through `json.dumps` / `json.loads`; and fuzz dataset lengths shorter than a single slot, a lone dataset, and a `batch_size` smaller than $K$, under both `PYTHONHASHSEED` values.
