Confirm two things with your recruiter before you prepare: how the 55 minutes actually splits if your loop differs from the default, and whether the round expects a shared deck or a shared screen. Everything below assumes the default split.

### Choosing the project

Pick a project you can go two or three follow-ups deep on every major decision in it, not only the one you would lead with. Two further things matter more than how impressive the project sounds on a slide: decisions that were actually yours rather than execution of someone else's design, and a measurable outcome — a number that moved, not merely a system that shipped. A project that maps to the team's domain is convenient but not required; a sharp deep dive on a tangential project holds up better under the Q&A half than a shallow one on a project that only sounds relevant.

Confidential detail is not a reason to set aside an otherwise strong project — sanitize it instead. Replace an exact absolute number with the relative change or the order of magnitude it represents ("cut p99 latency by roughly 40%" in place of the millisecond figures on an internal dashboard), replace a proprietary system's internal name with a description of what it does, and keep every piece of reasoning and every trade-off intact — sanitizing changes which numbers and names appear, not the substance of what you argue. If a follow-up asks for a number you have deliberately rounded or normalized this way, say so directly rather than inventing a precise-sounding figure to match the rounded one.

### Slide outline

A slide-by-slide structure with time budgets that sum to about eighteen minutes, leaving slack inside the 20–25 minute window for whatever arrives mid-presentation before you reach the later slides.

- **Slide 1 (1 min): title and one-line summary** — the system, who used it, over what period. Not: your background or the team's org chart.
- **Slide 2 (2 min): problem and context** — what existed before the project, why this problem and why now, what was explicitly out of scope. Not: a full requirements document.
- **Slide 3 (3 min): architecture** — a diagram of the main components and one request or one piece of data traced through them. Not: every internal service, only what later slides refer back to.
- **Slides 4–5 (2 min each): two key decisions, one slide each** — the alternative you did not take and the constraint that ruled it out. Not: a list of technology names with no reasoning attached.
- **Slide 6 (2 min): your role** — precisely what you personally designed, built, or decided, distinct from what the rest of the team did. Not: a claim on work that was actually a teammate's.
- **Slide 7 (3 min): results** — the metric, the before/after numbers, what they are measured against, and the cost-versus-return figure if the project's scale makes ROI a likely question. Not: a number you cannot explain how you computed.
- **Slide 8 (3 min): what you'd change** — the single biggest mistake, and what breaks first at 10x. Not: a vague "add more monitoring."
- **Slide 9 (backup, on standby): further detail** — a fuller architecture diagram, a third decision you did not have room for on slides 4–5, secondary metrics, scaling numbers. Shown only if asked.

### Problem and context

What it probes: whether the motivation is a real problem that existed before you touched it, sized and dated, rather than a justification assembled afterward for a project you wanted to build regardless.

Skeleton: name who had the problem, what they were doing about it before your project — nothing, a manual step, a worse tool — one number that shows its size, why this particular moment made it worth doing rather than a different time, and one thing you explicitly left out of scope and why.

Most common way to lose points: opening with the solution — "we built a system that..." — before the problem has been named, sized, or dated, so the motivation reads as invented to fit what was already built. Fix: rehearse the first ninety seconds so a specific person's problem, with a number attached, appears before you say what you built.

### Architecture and key decisions

What it probes: whether you can trace a request or a unit of data through the real system from memory, and whether every component in your own diagram is one you can open up on demand.

Skeleton: name the components in the order data or a request actually passes through them, trace one concrete example end to end, and for each decision that mattered, have one sentence ready for why it was made and what would have to change for you to decide differently today.

Most common way to lose points: a diagram with a box you cannot describe the interface of, because you inherited it or only ever called it. Fix: before the round, mark on your own diagram which components you built and which you only used, and prepare the one-sentence contract — input, output, guarantee — for every box you did not build, instead of guessing at what is inside it.

### Trade-offs and alternatives rejected

What it probes: whether a decision was actually weighed against real alternatives, or was the only option that was ever considered.

Skeleton: for each decision you expect to be pushed on, have the alternative named, the evidence or constraint that ruled it out at the time — not in hindsight — and the condition under which you would choose it today. When a follow-up proposes an alternative you had not prepared for, restate the assumption that alternative depends on and check it against your actual problem before defending against it; if the assumption does not hold in your case, say so and name what would have to be true for the alternative to apply, rather than forcing a defense of a comparison that does not fit.

Fictional example, for a deploy pipeline that gates each rollout stage on live error-rate metrics before advancing it:

- Alternative: Add the gate as a plugin to the existing CI tool · Why not, at the time: The CI tool's plugin API only saw build-time signals; it had no way to read the post-deploy metrics the gate needed to decide on · Under what condition you'd switch: The CI tool added a post-deploy hook API
- Alternative: Have an on-call engineer manually approve each rollout stage · Why not, at the time: Deploys were frequent enough that manual approval became the bottleneck the gate was meant to remove, and different engineers approved by different, inconsistent standards · Under what condition you'd switch: Deploy frequency dropped low enough that manual review stopped being the bottleneck

Most common way to lose points: naming the choice with no alternative attached — "we used X" with no Y or Z that was actually considered. Fix: before the round, write down every alternative you seriously weighed for your two or three biggest decisions, one row each, with the deciding evidence rather than just the alternative's name.

### Your contribution versus the team's

What it probes: whether "we" stands in for a division of labor you can state precisely — what was yours, and just as clearly, what was not.

Skeleton: one sentence naming your own share, tied to something verifiable ("I designed and built the ranking change; a teammate built the logging that measured it; the rollout call was the team's").

Most common way to lose points: an answer that is all "I," claiming work that was a teammate's, or all "we," using the team as cover when asked for your specific share — both read as avoiding the question. Fix: write the one sentence above before the round, naming your part, a named teammate's or role's part, and what was a joint or someone else's call.

### Measurement and results

What it probes: whether the metric is well defined and who actually owns it, whether other explanations for the number moving have been ruled out, and whether the project's return is defensible against its cost.

Skeleton: define the metric and how it is computed; name who defined it and owns it — you, product, a cross-functional group — and how the target was set; name what the result is measured against, a prior baseline, a control group, or a rollback; name one plausible confound and why you believe it is not the explanation; and if the project's scale invites an ROI question, translate the effort into a cost — engineer-time at a fully loaded rate is a defensible unit, so fifty engineer-years at roughly $400K per engineer-year is about $20M — and state what the measured return bought against that figure.

Most common way to lose points: a number you cannot explain the computation of, credit for a metric's definition claimed as your own when it was actually negotiated with another function, or "it was worth it" with no cost side to compare against. Fix: before the round, write the metric's formula, who signed off on the target, what it is compared against, and a rough cost figure for the project, so the ROI question has a rehearsed answer instead of an improvised one.

### Failures and what you would do differently

What it probes: a real cost you can name specifically, not a stylistic regret or a claim that nothing went wrong.

Skeleton: the single biggest mistake and the moment you actually realized it, not the moment it became convenient to admit; the hardest challenge you did not see coming and how you found out about it; two concrete things you would do differently with hindsight; and one thing you have since carried into a later project because of this one.

Most common way to lose points: "nothing, it went well," a trivial regret standing in for a real one, or a hardest-challenge answer vague enough to read as secondhand. Fix: pick a mistake with a real, nameable cost — rework, an incident, months of delay — have the specific moment you realized it ready, and name the one pattern from it you have since reused.

### Scaling and operational concerns

What it probes: whether you can reason about the actual bottleneck with real numbers, and who was responsible for the system once it was running.

Skeleton: name the resource that was the real bottleneck once the system was live and how you found it, say what breaks first at 10x, name the concrete fix and where that fix hits its own new limit, and say who operated the system day to day after launch and what that cost.

Most common way to lose points: a generic "we'd scale horizontally" with no resource named and no real number from the actual system. Fix: memorize two or three real numbers from the project — current throughput or volume, the actual bottleneck you hit, the cost of running it — before the round, and know which one moves first if the others hold steady.

### For research roles: experimental design

What it probes: whether the result the project claims is actually established — a fair comparison, an effect distinguishable from noise, checked for the ways it could be an artifact rather than real.

Skeleton: state what was held constant and what was varied, name the control or baseline the result is measured against and how it was tuned, state how you distinguished a real effect from noise — a significance test, or multiple seeds — and name one way the result could have been an artifact of the evaluation itself, such as a leak between training and evaluation data, or a baseline that was not tuned as carefully as the proposed method, and what you did to check for it.

Most common way to lose points: reporting a single run as the result with no measure of variance, or a baseline that was never given a fair chance. Fix: before the round, have the exact comparison ready — the same data, the same compute budget, the same tuning effort on both sides — and the specific check you ran for the most likely artifact in your own setup.

### When you do not know the answer

Separate a genuine unknown from something you can estimate live. For a number you have not memorized, say you do not have it exactly, then give the order of magnitude you are confident of or say how you would go find it; for a component you did not build, the same honesty applies to its internals, not only its interface. Never state a number you do not have as if you do: a stated gap costs you one question, while an invented number that turns out wrong undermines every other number you gave in the round.

### Recovering time when a question arrives early

A follow-up during the presentation itself draws on the same budget as the slide you have not reached yet. Mark two things on your own outline before the round: which slides carry content a later question depends on — context, architecture, results, since skipping these leaves the rest of the Q&A without a shared reference point — and which are compressible on the spot, such as one of the two decision slides reduced to its one-line verdict, or the backup slide dropped entirely. When you compress, say so out loud — "I'll fold the second decision into one line and move to results" — rather than letting the cut look unplanned. A presentation that has not reached the results and retrospective slides by the middle of its budget leaves no room to reach them, which shifts the follow-ups that would otherwise be about trade-offs and results onto whatever you did cover instead.
