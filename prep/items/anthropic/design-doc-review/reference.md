Worth confirming before reviewing: whether the interviewer wants the ranked list in full before any discussion, or the top risk first with the rest raised as time allows — this write-up gives the full ranking, as the numbered task asks. It also assumes the whole pipeline downstream of the fixed `run_batch` contract is open for revision, since nothing else in the document is marked as pinned.

### The review, ranked

- **"Each server completes a full batch of 50 requests every 100 ms" (Capacity estimate).** This is only true if every batch that reaches a server is completely full, which needs the server to always have at least 50 requests waiting the instant its previous batch finishes — the estimate assumes the one outcome that needs zero queueing margin, the opposite of what a capacity plan should assume. At the fill a real deployment achieves — the corrected estimate below uses 66.7%, itself already after 20% headroom is added on top — the same formula gives 30 servers, not 15. Every other number built on "500 requests/second per server" inherits this error. *Proposed change:* size the fleet from an achieved batch size below the maximum, with headroom on top, as in the corrected estimate below.

- **"35% of requests matched an entry already in that sample" (Response cache).** This measures whether a request repeats *at all* within a one-week, 3.2-million-request sample — an unbounded lookback of up to a week. The proposed cache holds only 250,000 entries under LRU eviction; at the document's own 6,500 requests/second effective load, a new entry displaces the oldest one roughly every 250,000 / 6,500 ≈ 38 seconds. A match found only by searching up to a week back is overwhelmingly likely to have already fallen out of a cache that forgets anything older than 38 seconds, unless repeats cluster inside that window — which a 35% weekly figure does not establish, and the document does not measure separately. If repeat gaps are spread roughly evenly across the week (a generous assumption, since nothing in the document suggests clustering), the same data implies a true hit rate near 35% × (38 s / 604,800 s) ≈ 0.002%: negligible, not a third of traffic. *Proposed change:* measure the hit rate by replaying the week through an actual bounded, evicting cache of the proposed size, not by checking for any match anywhere in the sample.

- **"Interactive and bulk requests are not distinguished once admitted" (Batching).** Bulk traffic is submitted programmatically and can arrive in a burst far larger than any single interactive request would generate — a scheduled reprocessing job enqueuing hundreds of thousands of requests at once is exactly the bulk traffic Goals says this system should carry. On one shared FIFO queue, that burst sits ahead of every interactive request submitted after it, and nothing in this document bounds how long that is. *Proposed change:* two logical queues, one per traffic class, each with its own servers or its own share of a common pool; splitting the corrected 30-server pool this way costs 2 extra servers to lost pooling efficiency (32 vs. 30, worked out below) — a small price for making sure bulk traffic cannot delay interactive traffic at all.

- **Nowhere in the document.** Nothing bounds how many requests can be queued, and nothing sheds load when demand exceeds capacity: every request that arrives is queued indefinitely, however far behind the servers already are. Losing half the corrected 30-server fleet to a bad rollout for two minutes — a realistic scenario the Rollout section does nothing to guard against — drops capacity to 7,500 requests/second against 10,000/second of demand; even after the fleet recovers, draining the 300,000-request backlog that built up takes another 60 seconds on top of the 120-second incident. With no cap, every one of those requests is still served, just increasingly late, instead of a bounded number being shed quickly so the rest keep meeting the SLA. *Proposed change:* cap the total admitted-but-unfinished count per queue at a small multiple of one batch cycle's worth of capacity; past that, reject new requests immediately, with a retry hint, shedding bulk traffic before interactive.

- **"assigns each new client connection to one of the servers by round robin" (Load balancing).** Round robin balances *connection count*, not *request rate* — it has no way to know a new connection will turn out to be a chatty client sending hundreds of requests a second. If two such connections land on the same server, which nothing here prevents, that server alone can be asked for more than its 500 requests/second ceiling while the fleet-wide average still looks perfectly healthy. The simulation below places three connections at about 467 requests/second among twenty connections, on ten servers at a healthy 70% fleet-wide average utilization: the busiest server alone is asked for about 590 requests/second, above its ceiling by itself, and its queue grows without bound over the run — its p99 wait grows from about 5.5 s to about 14.8 s as the run lengthens from 30 s to 80 s, instead of settling. *Proposed change:* route each request independently rather than pinning a connection to one server; routing by current backlog (for example, power of two choices: sample two servers, send to whichever reports the shorter queue) also protects against a server that is individually slow or draining, which round robin at any granularity cannot see. In the same simulation, backlog-aware routing holds p99 at about 0.2 s regardless of run length.

- **"it should retry the request with the same parameters" (Retries).** Nothing gives a retried request a way to find the original one; a slow-but-successful call and a genuinely dropped one look identical to the client, so both get retried, and the server runs the request again from scratch. Under exactly the degraded conditions items 1, 2, and 4 create — the moment retries are most likely — even a modest 5% retry rate turns 500 of the 10,000 requests/second into pure duplicate work: a full server's worth of capacity spent recomputing answers that were already produced. *Proposed change:* a client-supplied idempotency key, stored with the completed response for a short TTL; a retry carrying a seen key returns the stored result instead of running the request again.

- **Nowhere in the document.** No section says what happens to the up to 50 requests inside a `run_batch` call on a server that stops responding mid-call — no lease, no heartbeat, no detection. At a plausible 4-hour mean time between crashes per server, the corrected 30-server fleet loses a server about every 8 minutes; each time, up to 50 in-flight requests are silently dropped, with nothing to notice, retry, or report the loss. *Proposed change:* a lease per dispatched batch and a heartbeat from the server; a lease that expires without a heartbeat requeues its requests onto a fresh server, using the same idempotency key from item 6 so a request the client already resent separately doesn't run twice.

### Corrected capacity estimate

The formula is servers = ceil(QPS × batch_time / (achieved_batch_size × slots)), plus headroom — not the document's QPS × batch_time / max_batch_size, which is only the special case where achieved_batch_size equals the maximum on every single dispatch.

**Demand.** Item 2 shows the cache offset is not real; demand stays at the full 10,000 requests/second.

**Achieved batch size.** The document's own 30 ms max-wait, together with waiting out a busy server rather than closing a timed-out batch early, is short enough that once a server has any backlog at all, the wait timer stops being the binding constraint — the pending batch simply absorbs arrivals for as long as the server is busy, which tracks utilization directly (that part of the design needs no note; see Calibration). Targeting 80% average fill for provisioning gives achieved_batch_size = 0.8 × 50 = 40.

**Slots.** 1 — a server runs one `run_batch` call at a time, per the fixed contract.

**Raw.** ceil(10,000 × 0.1 / (40 × 1)) = ceil(25) = 25.

**Headroom.** +20%, enough to lose a couple of servers to a rolling deploy or absorb uneven load without breaching the fill target: 25 × 1.2 = 30.

**Realized.** At 30 servers, each carries 10,000 / 30 ≈ 333.3 requests/second, ρ ≈ 66.7%, achieved fill ≈ 33.3 of 50 — below the 80% used to size the raw count, which is the headroom doing its job: the same pattern applies throughout capacity planning, provisioning for the point that stays safe, not for the average.

**Conclusion.** 30 servers — double the document's 15.

Splitting the pool into an interactive queue and a bulk queue (item 3) applies the same formula to each share separately: interactive (9,000/s) needs ceil(900/40) = 23 raw, ×1.2 → 28; bulk (1,000/s) needs ceil(100/40) = 3 raw, ×1.2 → 4. 28 + 4 = 32, two more than the pooled 30 — the cost of losing some pooling efficiency to isolation, paid at both the raw and the headroom rounding step.

### Missing sections

**Observability.** Exporting the same request-count and latency metrics every other service already emits says nothing about *this* service's own failure modes. Before this ships it needs: the batch-fill distribution, so an under-filled batch shows up directly instead of being inferred later from a capacity shortfall; per-server queue depth and time since a server's batch last closed, so the imbalance in item 5 is visible live rather than only in a retrospective simulation; latency split into queueing and execution, so a slow response can be told apart from an overloaded queue; a live cache hit rate measured against the actual running cache, not the offline weekly-sample figure item 2 disputes; the retry and duplicate-completion rate once item 6's idempotency key exists; and the rate of mid-batch server loss from item 7, however it ends up being detected.

**Rollout.** "Run it alongside the existing path for a week, then switch all traffic over" names no criterion for what passing that week means, no canary percentage before all traffic moves, and no rollback trigger beyond someone deciding to stop. Before this ships it needs: a canary that starts at a small percentage of traffic and grows on explicit, met criteria, not a fixed week regardless of what happens; a rollback trigger tied to an SLO, such as interactive p99 above target for some sustained window, so reverting does not depend on someone noticing; a load test at the corrected 10,000 requests/second, not the document's 6,500, before any real traffic reaches the new path; and a stated behavior for a request already in flight on the old path at the moment the flag flips.

### The shared 8-GPU pool

The appendix's policy compares the two queues' estimated arrival rates and, when they are close, dispatches the large-model queue first. That is a tie-break for the moment when both a small batch and a large batch are ready and GPUs happen to be free; it says nothing about the rest of the time, which for a resource that needs gang scheduling — all 8 GPUs at once, not eight independent one-GPU slots — is the part that matters. Nothing in the policy ever holds a GPU back or stops the small-model queue from claiming one the instant it frees, so under any sustained small-model load a freed GPU is claimed by the next ready small batch before the tie-break has anything to act on. All 8 GPUs are rarely simultaneously idle, no matter how the tie-break is written, and the large-model queue starves — not merely waits longer.

The simulation below reproduces this directly. At a small-model load that keeps the pool a little over 90% busy on small work alone — not an extreme figure — every large request still completes within the 200-second run, but its p99 wait is about 194 seconds, within a few seconds of the entire run, against 0.12 seconds for small requests served in the meantime. For any real latency target that is starvation in practice, whether or not the queue is formally unbounded at this exact load.

**Proposed policy: atomic reservation with a bounded drain.** A fix needs two guarantees the document's policy has neither of: a bound on how long a formed large batch can wait, and a bound on how long any small request waits behind one. Small batches keep dispatching onto any free GPU the instant they are ready — nothing changes for the common case. What changes is what happens once a large batch has *formed*: instead of simply waiting for all 8 GPUs to align by chance, it starts a clock. Once that clock reaches `aging` with the pool still not entirely free, the dispatcher freezes admission of any *new* small batch — batches already running are left to finish their own 100 ms — until the instant all 8 GPUs are simultaneously idle, at which point it reserves them as one atomic unit and launches the large batch. The first guarantee follows immediately: `aging` plus at most one more small-batch cycle. The second follows from the freeze itself: once a large batch is running, no small request already queued waits longer than that one run plus however long its own queue took to drain before the freeze began. At `aging` = 150 ms the simulation puts the large model's p99 wait at about 0.87 s and the small model's at about 0.33 s, against roughly 194 s for the large model under the document's policy.

**Utilization cost.** This fix is not free, but most of what it costs was never avoidable: holding all 8 GPUs for a batch that needs all 8 spends about 8.1% of GPU-seconds under either policy, the document's or the fix, since both eventually run every large batch to completion — reserving a gang-scheduled resource costs the same no matter how the queue in front of it is managed. The fix adds one further cost on top, the drain itself: once the pool starts waiting out the small batches still running, a GPU that finishes early has nothing to do until the slowest one catches up, because only then can all 8 be handed to the large batch together. At `aging` = 150 ms that idle time comes to about 3.1% of GPU-seconds; stretching `aging` to 1 s cuts it to about 2.4% by making drains rarer and fuller, at the cost of pushing the large model's p99 wait to about 1.7 s, roughly double. `aging` is therefore a dial between the large model's tail latency and the fleet's utilization, not a setting to optimize away — no value of it drives idle time to zero, since that would mean knowing in advance which small batch will finish last and steering new work elsewhere just before it does.

### Calibration

Two places in the document need no note, and saying so is as much a part of the review as flagging what is wrong. The 30 ms max-wait, together with waiting out a busy server rather than closing a timed-out batch early, is exactly the right rule: once a server has any backlog, the wait timer stops binding and the achieved batch size tracks utilization on its own, which is what makes an 80% fill target reasonable to provision for in the first place. Model isolation — a server pinned to one model, with the router rejecting a mismatched request before it reaches any queue — already closes off the one way a batch could end up mixing two different models' requests; there is nothing to add there.

The `run_batch` contract itself — fixed batch size, fixed latency, one call at a time — is in the same category for a different reason: it is pinned by a different team and stated as a non-goal, so a review that spends its time arguing for continuous batching instead is answering a question that was not asked, however true the argument might be.

Everything ranked above earns its place by a different test: each item is either demonstrably wrong on its own terms (the full-batch assumption, the cache measurement) or silent about a failure mode that a plausible, ordinary event would trigger (a rollout that removes half the fleet, a server that crashes mid-batch) — not a hypothetical edge case or a stylistic preference. Ranking by the consequence of being wrong, rather than by how many issues can be listed, is what keeps a ten-minute read from turning into a pass over every sentence: items 1 and 2 alone double the required server count and would be caught by the first load test after launch; items 6 and 7 matter, but only once something has already gone wrong.

### Follow-ups

- A longer max-wait would raise achieved fill further, but 30 ms was already chosen so the timer rarely binds once there is any backlog — the remaining fill gap comes from headroom, not from a short timer, so lengthening it would add latency for little throughput gain.
- Not every workload makes a response cache worthless — item 2's argument is about *this* cache holding *this* traffic; genuinely short-lived repeats (a client retrying an identical submission within seconds) would show up directly in a bounded-cache replay, the measurement item 2 asks for instead of the one the document ran.
- An idempotency key two genuinely different requests reuse by mistake, rather than a legitimate retry, is indistinguishable from a retry at the store unless the stored record is checked against the new request's content, not just its key; hashing the request body into the stored record and rejecting a mismatch catches it.
- A connection that starts light and turns heavy later is invisible to round robin at creation time either way; fixing item 5 by routing every request independently, rather than only fixing where new connections land, closes this case along with the one the simulation shows.
- Once bulk traffic is split from interactive (item 3), its queue has no per-request latency target at all and could use a longer max-wait than 30 ms for a higher achieved fill — the same direction the corrected estimate already takes by giving bulk traffic fewer, more heavily loaded servers.

    policy="opportunistic" is the document's appendix: a large batch launches only at the instant
    every GPU happens to be simultaneously free, and nothing ever holds a GPU back to make that more
    likely. policy="reserve" adds an aging-triggered drain: once a formed large batch has waited
    `aging` with the pool not entirely free, no *new* small batch is admitted (already-running ones
    finish normally) until all n_gpus are free, which are then reserved atomically for the large batch.
