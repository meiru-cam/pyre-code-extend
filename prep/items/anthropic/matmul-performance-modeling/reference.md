Two points worth confirming with the interviewer: whether "bytes moved" prices every matmul on its own inputs and output even when consecutive layers share a tensor (this page's rule: yes — no fusion across separate kernels, so a shared activation is written once and read once), and whether the ridge point is a property of the hardware alone. It is: $I^\star = P/BW = 312\times10^{12} / 1.5\times10^{12} = 208$ FLOP/byte, fixed for every part below.

### Part 1

**Shape A** works the formulas once in full. With $(m,k,n) = (8, 4{,}096, 4{,}096)$:

$$\text{FLOPs} = 2\cdot 8\cdot 4{,}096\cdot 4{,}096 = 268{,}435{,}456,$$

$$\text{bytes} = 2\bigl(8\cdot4{,}096 + 4{,}096\cdot4{,}096 + 8\cdot4{,}096\bigr) = 2\cdot 16{,}842{,}752 = 33{,}685{,}504,$$

$$I = \frac{268{,}435{,}456}{33{,}685{,}504} \approx 7.97 \text{ FLOP/byte} < 208 = I^\star \implies \text{memory-bound},$$

$$t = \max\!\left(\frac{268{,}435{,}456}{312\times10^{12}},\ \frac{33{,}685{,}504}{1.5\times10^{12}}\right) = \max(0.86,\ 22.46)\ \mu s = 22.46\ \mu s.$$

The same formulas, applied to B, C and D:

- Shape: A · FLOPs: $2.684\times10^{8}$ · bytes: $3.369\times10^{7}$ · $I$ (FLOP/byte): 7.97 · regime: memory · $t$: 22.46 μs
- Shape: B · FLOPs: $6.872\times10^{10}$ · bytes: $6.711\times10^{7}$ · $I$ (FLOP/byte): 1,024.00 · regime: compute · $t$: 220.25 μs
- Shape: C · FLOPs: $2.147\times10^{9}$ · bytes: $3.460\times10^{7}$ · $I$ (FLOP/byte): 62.06 · regime: memory · $t$: 23.07 μs
- Shape: D · FLOPs: $1.374\times10^{11}$ · bytes: $1.007\times10^{8}$ · $I$ (FLOP/byte): 1,365.33 · regime: compute · $t$: 440.51 μs

B is A with $m$ grown from 8 to 2,048 at the same $k=n=4{,}096$: intensity rises from 7.97 to 1,024 and the regime flips from memory- to compute-bound. C and D show the same flip along $k$ instead, at the same $m=n=4{,}096$: growing $k$ from 64 to 4,096 raises intensity from 62.06 to 1,365.33. Both are instances of one fact, proved next for every variable, not only $m$ and $k$.

For fixed $k,n$, intensity as a function of $m$ is $I(m) = \dfrac{2mkn}{s(m(k+n)+kn)} = \dfrac{2kn}{s}\, g(m)$ with $g(m) = \dfrac{m}{m(k+n)+kn}$. Then

$$g'(m) = \frac{\bigl(m(k+n)+kn\bigr) - m(k+n)}{\bigl(m(k+n)+kn\bigr)^{2}} = \frac{kn}{\bigl(m(k+n)+kn\bigr)^{2}} > 0,$$

so $I$ is strictly increasing in $m$, from $I(0) = 0$ towards $\lim_{m\to\infty} I(m) = 2kn/(s(k+n))$ — the harmonic mean of $k$ and $n$, divided by $s$ — approached but never reached. Bytes $s(mk+kn+mn)$ and FLOPs $2mkn$ are each a symmetric function of $(m,k,n)$ — the elementary symmetric sum of the three pairwise products, and twice their triple product — so $I(m,k,n)$ is symmetric too, and the argument above applies unchanged with any one of $m, k, n$ standing in for "$m$" and the other two for "$k, n$". Growing any single one of $m, k, n$, holding the other two fixed, strictly increases the intensity, so it can only ever move a matmul towards compute-bound, never away from it — never the other way, for any of the three variables. Reaching compute-bound is not guaranteed, though: growing one variable only drives $I$ towards the ceiling set by the other two, $2xy/(s(x+y))$, and if that ceiling already sits below $I^\star$ no amount of growth in the third variable alone crosses the ridge. A and C share the same other-two values $\{4{,}096, 4{,}096\}$, hence the same ceiling $2\cdot4{,}096^2/(2\cdot 8{,}192) = 2{,}048$ FLOP/byte, comfortably above $I^\star = 208$: growing $m$ past B's 2,048, or growing $k$ further from D's 4,096, both keep pushing further into compute-bound, towards that same ceiling, since both are instances of the one symmetric fact above.

### Part 2

Every layer, of either type, has the same FLOPs and the same bytes moved: $\text{FLOPs}_\ell = 2Tdf = 2\cdot20{,}480\cdot8{,}192\cdot32{,}768 = 10{,}995{,}116{,}277{,}760$, and $\text{bytes}_\ell = s(Td+df+Tf) = 2(20{,}480\cdot8{,}192 + 8{,}192\cdot32{,}768 + 20{,}480\cdot32{,}768) = 2{,}214{,}592{,}512$ — a type-D layer swaps which of the three products is the input and which is the output, but the set $\{Td, df, Tf\}$ is the same either way. Intensity $I_\ell = 10{,}995{,}116{,}277{,}760 / 2{,}214{,}592{,}512 \approx 4{,}964.85$ FLOP/byte, far above $I^\star = 208$, so every layer is compute-bound: its predicted time is set by compute alone, $t_\ell = \text{FLOPs}_\ell/P \approx 35.24$ ms (transfer alone would take only $\text{bytes}_\ell/BW \approx 1.48$ ms).

With all 72 layers identical in cost,

$$\text{total compute time} = \frac{72\cdot\text{FLOPs}_\ell}{P} \approx 2{,}537.33\text{ ms}, \qquad
\text{total transfer time} = \frac{72\cdot\text{bytes}_\ell}{BW} \approx 106.30\text{ ms}.$$

Total transfer time is about 4.2% of total compute time, so — as at the single-layer level — the whole pass is compute-bound, and its predicted latency is the 2,537.33 ms compute figure, not the sum of the two.

**Memory.** The tensors resident at any instant during this pass are (a) all 72 weight matrices, kept resident for the whole pass since each is needed again before the pass ends, and (b) the currently-executing layer's input $X_\ell$ and output $X_{\ell+1}$ — every earlier activation has already been consumed and freed, and no later one exists yet. (a) totals $72dfs = 72\cdot8{,}192\cdot32{,}768\cdot2 = 38{,}654{,}705{,}664$ bytes $\approx 38.65$ GB, the same figure for every layer since a type-U weight and a type-D weight both have $df$ elements. (b) totals $Ts(d+f) = 20{,}480\cdot2\cdot40{,}960 = 1{,}677{,}721{,}600$ bytes $\approx 1.68$ GB — also the same for every layer, since a type-U layer's input-plus-output is $T(d+f)$ elements and a type-D layer's is $T(f+d)$, the same sum. Together, weights plus one layer's live activations come to $38.65 + 1.68 \approx 40.33$ GB.

That is over the 40 GB budget by about $0.33$ GB — easy to miss by eye, since the weights alone would fit with $40 - 38.65 \approx 1.35$ GB to spare. It is specifically the one layer's worth of live activations (1.68 GB, driven by the $T=20{,}480$-token prefill) that exceeds that spare capacity and tips the total over. This is why Part 3 splits the stack across two devices.

### Part 3

**Pipeline parallelism.** Every layer costs the same $t_\ell \approx 35.24$ ms (Part 2), so each device's 36 layers take $36\,t_\ell \approx 1{,}268.67$ ms — exactly half of the single-device total, since the single-device total is $72\,t_\ell$. Layer 36 is even, a type-D layer, so the handed-off activation has shape $T\times d$: $\text{bytes} = sTd = 2\cdot20{,}480\cdot8{,}192 = 335{,}544{,}320 \approx 335.54$ MB, taking $335{,}544{,}320 / (400\times10^{9}) \approx 0.84$ ms over the interconnect. End-to-end latency:

$$t_{\text{PP}} = 36\,t_\ell + \frac{sTd}{B_{\text{net}}} + 36\,t_\ell = 72\,t_\ell + \frac{sTd}{B_{\text{net}}}.$$

$72\,t_\ell$ is exactly the Part 2 total compute time, $\approx 2{,}537.33$ ms; adding the one handoff, $\approx 0.84$ ms, gives $t_{\text{PP}} \approx 2{,}538.17$ ms. Splitting the layers across two devices does not reduce the latency of one input at all, since the two devices still run one after the other.

Each device holds half the weights, $38.65/2 \approx 19.33$ GB, plus one layer's live activations, $\approx 1.68$ GB (only one layer is ever mid-flight on a device at a time): $\approx 21.01$ GB per device, comfortably under 40 GB. A single layer's own input, output and weight together are only $sTd + sTf + sdf \approx 2.21$ GB, trivially resident alongside the rest. Total interconnect traffic for the whole pass is the one handoff: $\approx 335.54$ MB per device.

**Tensor parallelism.** A type-U layer, sharded $2$ ways: each device reads the full input ($Td$ elements), its own half of the weight ($df/2$ elements), and writes its own half of the output ($Tf/2$ elements); FLOPs are exactly halved, $Tdf$. Bytes: $s(Td + df/2 + Tf/2) = 2(20{,}480\cdot8{,}192 + 8{,}192\cdot16{,}384 + 20{,}480\cdot16{,}384) = 1{,}275{,}068{,}416$. Both the halved FLOPs and this byte count give an intensity still far above $I^\star$, so this shard, too, is compute-bound, at $t = Tdf/P \approx 17.62$ ms. A type-D layer, sharded the same way, has the same FLOPs ($Tfd = Tdf$) and a different byte count — $s(Tf + fd/2 + Td/2) = 1{,}778{,}384{,}896$ — but is still compute-bound at the same $t \approx 17.62$ ms (the compute term is identical and already dominates both byte counts). After each layer, the two devices exchange their output shards: since each device already holds a disjoint, final slice of the output, this needs only a pure all-gather, not a full all-reduce — no reduce-scatter step, so half of Part 4's ring volume; at $p=2$ that means each device simply sends its own shard. A type-U layer's output has $Tf$ elements, so each device sends $sTf/2 = 671{,}088{,}640$ bytes $\approx 671.09$ MB, taking $\approx 1.68$ ms; a type-D layer's output has $Td$ elements, so each device sends $sTd/2 = 167{,}772{,}160$ bytes $\approx 167.77$ MB, taking $\approx 0.42$ ms. Summing 36 layers of each type, with the exchange added after each layer's compute since the next layer needs the gathered result: type-U layers cost $17.62 + 1.68 = 19.298$ ms each, $36$ of them $\approx 694.73$ ms; type-D layers cost $17.62 + 0.42 = 18.040$ ms each, $36$ of them $\approx 649.43$ ms; together,

$$t_{\text{TP}} \approx 694.73 + 649.43 = 1{,}344.16\text{ ms}.$$

Tensor parallelism finishes this one input in about $1{,}344.16 / 2{,}537.33 \approx 53.0\%$ of the single-device time — nearly half, since compute genuinely splits across the two devices — at the cost of communicating on every one of the 72 layers. Total interconnect traffic per device is $36\cdot671.09\text{ MB} + 36\cdot167.77\text{ MB} \approx 30.20$ GB — about 90 times pipeline parallelism's single 335.54 MB handoff. Per-device memory: every weight is halved ($38.65/2 \approx 19.33$ GB total) and, once a layer's exchange completes, both devices hold that layer's *full* input and output, not a half — so the live-activation figure is the same $\approx 1.68$ GB as the single-device and pipeline-parallel cases, not half of it. Per-device memory is therefore $\approx 21.01$ GB — numerically the same total as pipeline parallelism, because both schemes happen to halve the same weight bytes here and neither shrinks the activation footprint.

**The trade.** For this one input, tensor parallelism dominates pipeline parallelism outright on every number computed here: lower latency, and the same per-device memory. Pipeline parallelism's real advantage does not appear for a single input at all: with several inputs in flight, device $B$ can be finishing input 1's second half while device $A$ is already running input 2's first half, filling the pipeline and raising throughput without adding communication — tensor parallelism, in contrast, forces both devices to advance through every layer in lockstep, so it cannot overlap independent inputs the same way and pays its communication cost on every layer, for every input, regardless of how many are in flight. A real deployment typically combines both: enough tensor parallelism to fit and speed up one layer within a fast, single-node interconnect, and pipeline parallelism across that to add throughput and to reach a model too large for even a tensor-parallel group's combined memory.

### Part 4

**Tensor sharding.** Per-device FLOPs are $4Tdf/p$, split evenly between the two matmuls, each $2Tdf/p$; per-device weight bytes are $2dfs/p$. At $p=1$ this is just the unsharded block: $4Tdf/P = 4\cdot2{,}048\cdot8{,}192\cdot32{,}768 / (312\times10^{12}) \approx 7.05$ ms, entirely compute (intensity is far above $I^\star$ at this size), with $2dfs \approx 1.07$ GB of weights. For $p>1$, each device's own compute-plus-memory time is the sum of its two matmuls' own roofline times (each still individually compute-bound at every $p$ used below, since $d,f$ are large), and the all-reduce of the $T\times d$ partial output — logical size $S = Tds = 2{,}048\cdot8{,}192\cdot2 = 33{,}554{,}432$ bytes — adds $2(p-1)S/(p\,B_{\text{net}})$ on top, since it cannot overlap with this block's own compute:

- $p$: 1 · FLOPs/device: $2.199\times10^{12}$ · weight/device: 1.0737 GB · comm/device: 0 · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 0 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 7.05 ms · bound: compute
- $p$: 2 · FLOPs/device: $1.100\times10^{12}$ · weight/device: 0.5369 GB · comm/device: 33.55 MB · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 0.08 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 3.61 ms · bound: compute
- $p$: 4 · FLOPs/device: $5.498\times10^{11}$ · weight/device: 0.2684 GB · comm/device: 50.33 MB · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 0.13 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 1.89 ms · bound: compute
- $p$: 8 · FLOPs/device: $2.749\times10^{11}$ · weight/device: 0.1342 GB · comm/device: 58.72 MB · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 0.15 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 1.03 ms · bound: compute
- $p$: 16 · FLOPs/device: $1.374\times10^{11}$ · weight/device: 0.0671 GB · comm/device: 62.91 MB · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 0.16 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 0.60 ms · bound: compute
- $p$: 32 · FLOPs/device: $6.872\times10^{10}$ · weight/device: 0.0336 GB · comm/device: 65.01 MB · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 0.16 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 0.38 ms · bound: compute
- $p$: 64 · FLOPs/device: $3.436\times10^{10}$ · weight/device: 0.0168 GB · comm/device: 66.06 MB · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 0.17 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 0.28 ms · bound: comm

(comm/device is bytes sent, $2(p-1)S/p$; $t_{\text{comm}}$ uses $B_{\text{net}} = 400$ GB/s.) Compute time halves with every doubling of $p$ while communication grows only from 0 towards its ceiling $2S/B_{\text{net}} \approx 0.17$ ms, so compute stays the larger term through $p=32$; only past $p=43$ (found by extending this table) does communication overtake compute-plus-memory, which is why the table's last row already reads "comm". Latency keeps falling across the whole table, but with sharply diminishing returns: $p=32\to64$ doubles the device count and roughly doubles communication yet only takes latency from 0.38 to 0.28 ms, a 28% cut, even though weight/device is again cut exactly in half (0.0336 GB to 0.0168 GB). A smaller weight footprint is necessary for a smaller memory budget, but by itself it does not translate into proportionally smaller latency once communication is a meaningful share of the total.

**Token sharding.** Per-device FLOPs are the same $4Tdf/p$ as tensor sharding (the same total work, divided the same way), but weight bytes per device stay at the full, unsharded $2dfs \approx 1.07$ GB for every $p$, since $W_1, W_2$ are replicated rather than split, and there is no communication inside this block. Per-device time is again each matmul's own roofline time, now with $T/p$ rows through the *full* weight: at $p=1$ it is identical to tensor sharding's $p=1$ row, 7.05 ms, compute-bound; by $p=8$ it has fallen to 0.88 ms, still compute-bound; but from $p=16$ on it is memory-bound at 0.73 ms, barely moving further (0.72 ms at $p=32$, 0.72 ms at $p=64$) — because reading the *full*, unsharded $W_1$ and $W_2$ from HBM on every device, regardless of how few rows that device owns, has a floor of $2dfs/BW \approx 0.72$ ms that no amount of extra sharding removes. Tensor sharding has no such floor, since its weight bytes shrink with $p$ too, which is why it keeps improving (to 0.28 ms at $p=64$) well past where token sharding has stalled.

**A slower interconnect.** Repeating tensor sharding's bound classification with $B_{\text{net}}' = 25$ GB/s in place of 400 GB/s changes nothing about compute or weight bytes, only $t_{\text{comm}} = 2(p-1)S/(p\,B_{\text{net}}')$, which is $16\times$ larger at every $p$:

- $p$: 2 · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 1.34 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 4.87 ms · bound: compute
- $p$: 4 · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 2.01 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 3.78 ms · bound: comm
- $p$: 16 · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 2.52 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 2.96 ms · bound: comm
- $p$: 64 · $t_{\text{comm}}$: 2.64 ms · $t_{\text{total}}$: 2.75 ms · bound: comm

Here communication already dominates by $p=4$, and $p=16\to64$ — four times the devices — buys only 2.96 ms $\to$ 2.75 ms, a 7% improvement, almost all of it spent on a shrinking compute term against an almost-flat communication floor. The lesson is the same as above, sharper: past the point where communication dominates, adding devices mostly adds communication, not speed.

**Overlap.** For this one block processing one batch of tokens, the all-reduce cannot overlap with this block's own compute: $Y_i$ needs $H_i$, $H_i$ needs $X$, and whatever consumes $Y$ needs the all-reduce to have finished, so every step is on one dependency chain. Overlap needs independent work to fill the gap. Two real sources of it: (a) multiple independent requests or micro-batches in flight — while one batch's all-reduce is in progress, a device can already be running another, independent batch's local matmul, exactly as pipeline parallelism overlaps independent inputs in Part 3; (b) splitting one batch's own reduction into column chunks and pipelining it against compute — start reducing the first chunk of $Y_i$'s columns while the matmul for the remaining columns is still running — which shortens the exposed, non-overlapped tail of the collective without changing the total bytes it moves.

### Follow-ups

- **Batch size and decode.** A decode step's matmul looks like shape A: few tokens ($m$ small) against a large weight, so intensity is low and time is set by reading the weight from HBM, almost independently of $m$ (bytes are dominated by the $kn$ weight term while $m$ stays small). Batching several requests' decode steps together raises $m$ at no extra weight traffic, so FLOPs grow while bytes barely do — intensity rises towards the ceiling proved in Part 1 — and throughput improves close to linearly with batch size until the ceiling is approached and the step turns compute-bound, after which further batching adds latency without adding much throughput.
- **Below the roofline.** Real kernels rarely reach the full $\max(\text{FLOPs}/P,\text{bytes}/BW)$: imperfect tiling wastes some FLOPs or bytes on padding when a dimension does not divide the hardware's tile size, a kernel launch has fixed overhead that a short matmul cannot amortise, compute and memory access do not overlap perfectly inside real hardware, and a network collective pays protocol and synchronisation overhead beyond the bytes this page counts. The roofline number is a lower bound on time, not a prediction of it.
- **Lower precision.** Hardware that computes fp8 at roughly double the bf16 FLOP/s, while bytes stay bf16-sized (only the multiply-accumulate itself drops to fp8, weights and activations still read and written at 2 bytes/element), doubles $P$ without changing $BW$ — the ridge point doubles, so some matmuls that were comfortably compute-bound in bf16 become memory-bound in fp8, and gain nothing from the faster compute. fp8 only delivers close to its full speedup where storage is *also* quantised to 1 byte/element, halving bytes alongside the doubled FLOP/s and leaving intensity, and the bound regime, unchanged.
- **KV-cache reads.** Decode-time attention reads a key/value cache that grows with the sequence length seen so far, on top of the weight bytes this page counts; a longer conversation means more cache bytes per decode step at essentially the same tiny FLOPs, pushing intensity down further and making decode more memory-bound the longer a sequence runs, independently of the batch-size effect above.
