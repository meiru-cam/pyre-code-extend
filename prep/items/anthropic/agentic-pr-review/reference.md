Confirm with the interviewer, if it is not already settled, that the written review comments are the graded deliverable of Part 1 (not a transcript of the assistant's chat), and that "mergeable" means mergeable into the codebase as it stands today, not mergeable after some unstated amount of future work.

### Working with the assistant

The time budget is unforgiving — four reviews and one hands-on fix — so what the assistant is asked to do changes across the round.

For Part 1, the assistant is useful for a mechanical first pass on each diff: "list every line this diff adds or removes and, for each, what observable behavior changes" produces a draft to edit, not a comment to paste. It is not useful for the verdict itself: asked in general terms whether PR #3 "looks OK," it tends to answer in general terms too — pickle is well documented, the diff is small. The question that actually reaches the defect is specific to this code: "`load()` opens a file at a caller-supplied path — list every place in this repository, present or plausible, that calls `save` or `load` with a path a value from outside the process could influence." That is answerable from the file, line by line; "does this look safe" is not. The same applies to PR #2: instead of asking whether moving the check outside the lock is safe, ask for one interleaving of two threads, line by line, that reaches the duplicate-id check with both seeing `job_id not in self._jobs`. If the assistant cannot produce one, the claim that the PR is safe carries no weight; if it can, the interleaving is the review comment, almost verbatim.

Diffs the assistant proposes for Part 2 get read the way a colleague's PR would, not skimmed for a green checkmark. Asked to make PR #1's batch atomic, a first draft that calls `self.submit(...)` in a loop from inside `with self._lock:` is a plausible answer, since it reuses existing, tested code — and it would deadlock on the first multi-item batch, because `threading.Lock` is not reentrant and `submit` takes the same lock again before the outer `with` exits. Running the new tests once catches this regardless of whether it was spotted by inspection first. A change is worth submitting only once its author can say in one sentence why each line is needed, independent of the assistant's own explanation for it — if that sentence cannot be produced, the line is dropped or sent back.

With roughly 55 minutes for four reviews plus one implementation, about 5 minutes per review — writing down a verdict already reached while reading, not composing one inside the assistant — leaves the rest for Part 2. That budget is itself why PR #1 is the one improved below: a correct fix to PR #2 or PR #3 would need to be proven, not just rewritten, and proving either one (a forced-interleaving test, or a real redesign of the persistence format) does not fit in what is left once four reviews are written.

### Part 1

**PR #1 — `submit_many`.** Solves batch submission at startup, replacing each caller's own loop over `submit` with one call. The implementation is a one-line list comprehension that calls `self.submit` once per item and collects the results; no other method changes.

- The description's performance claim is not what the diff does: `submit_many` calls `self.submit`, and `submit` still takes `self._lock` on every call, so the batch acquires the lock once per item, exactly as the loop it replaces did. The comment worth leaving is not "this is wrong" — it still works — but that the description overstates what changed, and a reader who trusts the description over the diff would believe a benefit that is not there.
- No test for an empty batch (`submit_many([])`; harmless here, just unstated), and none for a duplicate id *within* a batch or between the batch and a job already in the queue. On that duplicate, `self.submit` raises `ValueError` on the *n*-th item, but the first *n* - 1 have already been submitted and stay in the queue — the call is not atomic, and nothing here says whether that is intended.
- Mergeable: not as it stands. The implementation needs no change if partial submission on a duplicate id is the intended behavior, but that intent has to be written down and tested, and the two missing edge cases above need tests either way; the misleading performance claim should come out of the description.

**PR #2 — lock contention in `submit`.** Solves (or aims to solve) lock contention under a submission burst, by moving the duplicate-id check ahead of `with self._lock:` so the common case, a fresh id, spends less time holding the lock. Touches only `submit`; no test file changes.

- `if job_id in self._jobs` and the insertion that follows it are no longer one atomic step. Two threads calling `submit("x", ...)` at the same moment can both evaluate the check before either has inserted `"x"` into `self._jobs`; both see `"x" not in self._jobs`, both proceed, and both succeed — neither raises `ValueError`, although the PR's own description says "a duplicate id still raises `ValueError`." Whichever of the two `self._jobs["x"] = job` assignments runs last wins; the other caller's `Job` object is silently discarded even though its `submit` call returned normally. Any caller that relies on the exception to detect a collision (for instance, retried submission of the same job id, a common way to make submission idempotent) loses that guarantee precisely under the concurrent load this PR is optimizing for.
- No new test covers concurrent submission of the same id — the one behavior this change touches.
- The performance motivation itself is asserted, not measured: the description cites profiling but the PR carries no benchmark, and the check moved outside the lock is a single dict lookup, not an expensive operation, so the win it is trading correctness for is not established.
- Mergeable: no. This is a regression on the one property (rejecting a duplicate id) the module explicitly contracts for, it is silent (no exception, no log line), and the fix is not a smaller version of this diff — it is reverting to checking and inserting under one uninterrupted hold of `self._lock`.

**PR #3 — pickle persistence.** Solves representing non-JSON-safe payloads in a saved job. Touches only `save` and `load`, replacing `json.dump`/`json.load` with `pickle.dump`/`pickle.load` and switching the file mode from text to binary; call sites are unchanged, which is exactly why this reads as a safe, drop-in refactor at a glance.

- `pickle.load` executes code while deserializing: a crafted file can call arbitrary Python through an object's `__reduce__` the moment `load` reads it. `json.load` has no such path — unparseable input raises `json.JSONDecodeError`, or `UnicodeDecodeError` if the bytes are not even valid text, and nothing else runs. Whether this is exploitable depends on whether a `path` ever reaches `load` that the process itself did not just write with `save` — a restored volume, an uploaded crash dump, a path derived from a job id — and the PR does not discuss that boundary at all, let alone defend it.
- Old snapshots written by the current `save` are plain JSON text; the new `load` opens them in binary mode and calls `pickle.load` on JSON bytes, which fails rather than reading them, with no migration and no mention in the description that the format change breaks existing files.
- No new test for `save`/`load` at all; in particular nothing exercises the richer payload types (namedtuple, dataclass, numpy array) the description gives as the motivation, so the one thing this PR claims to newly support is untested.
- Mergeable: no, and not fixable by adjusting this diff. If richer payloads are a real requirement, the answer is a payload encoding that cannot execute code on load — for example JSON plus a small, explicit registry of extra types the loader is allowed to reconstruct — not a general-purpose deserializer pointed at a file path.

**PR #4 — pluggable scheduling policies.** Solves (for a use case that does not exist in this repository yet) letting `pop_ready` use a scheduling rule other than priority-then-FIFO. Touches the top of the file (new `SchedulingPolicy` interface and registry), `Job.__init__` (new `metadata` field), `JobQueue.__init__` (new `policy` parameter), and `pop_ready` (delegates to the policy).

- `Job.__init__(..., metadata={})` gives `metadata` a mutable default argument. Every `Job` created without an explicit `metadata=` shares the *same* dict object, so writing to one job's `metadata` silently changes every other job's. This is a concrete, provable bug independent of any opinion about the design, and it ships even though no policy in this PR reads or writes `metadata`.
- Only one concrete policy, `PriorityPolicy`, exists; the interface, the registry, and the new constructor parameter have no second implementation to be exercised against, so nothing here can yet show the abstraction is the right shape for the round-robin use case the description motivates it with.
- `SchedulingPolicy.select`'s docstring does not say whether an implementation may assume `self._lock` is already held when it runs (`pop_ready` calls it from inside the lock); `PriorityPolicy` needs no locking of its own, so the question does not surface here, but a future policy author has no way to answer it.
- `_resolve_policy` looks up an unknown string policy name in `_POLICIES` with plain indexing, so `JobQueue(policy="round_robin")` before that policy exists fails with a bare `KeyError`, not a clear error at the call site. No test exercises `policy=`, `SchedulingPolicy`, `PriorityPolicy`, or `metadata` at all.
- Mergeable: no. The mutable-default bug is a hard blocker by itself; past that, this is a scope question for a conversation with the author, not a line-by-line fix — ship `PriorityPolicy`'s behavior unchanged today and defer the plugin surface until a second policy actually needs it, or land the interface alone with a real second implementation in the same PR so it is reviewable.

### Part 2

PR #1 is the one whose remaining work is bounded and fully verifiable inside what is left of the time box. PR #2 and PR #3 are not partial fixes away from mergeable — PR #2 needs its concurrency claim actually proven, not just re-asserted, and PR #3 needs a different persistence design, not a smaller diff. PR #4's mutable-default bug is a one-line fix, but the PR's real problem is scope, which is a decision for the author to make, not one to make unilaterally on their behalf. PR #1's implementation is already correct for its stated (non-atomic) behavior; what is missing is deciding and testing the one thing the description left silent — what happens on a duplicate id inside a batch — and, since the description's own performance claim is worth honoring rather than deleting, actually making the batch take the lock once.

The fix validates every id before inserting any job, under one unbroken hold of `self._lock`, so a batch either succeeds completely or leaves the queue exactly as it found it:

```python
def submit_many(self, items):
    """items: an iterable of (job_id, payload, priority) triples. Submits the whole batch atomically:
    if any job_id is already taken -- by a job already in the queue, or by an earlier item in this same
    batch -- the call raises ValueError and no job in the batch is created. Returns the list of created
    Job objects, in the given order, on success."""
    items = list(items)
    with self._lock:
        seen = set()
        for job_id, payload, priority in items:
            if job_id in self._jobs or job_id in seen:
                raise ValueError(f"duplicate job id {job_id!r}")
            seen.add(job_id)
        created = []
        # NOTE: inserts directly rather than calling self.submit(), which would deadlock here --
        # self._lock is a plain threading.Lock, not reentrant, and submit() takes it too.
        for job_id, payload, priority in items:
            job = Job(job_id, payload, priority, "pending", 0, 3)
            self._jobs[job_id] = job
            heapq.heappush(self._heap, (-priority, next(self._counter), job_id))
            created.append(job)
        return created


JobQueue.submit_many = submit_many
```

Validating first and inserting second, both under the same lock acquisition, is what makes this safe under concurrent callers: nothing can observe the queue between the check and the insert, the same property PR #2 got wrong for a single `submit`. Materializing `items` into a list up front means a batch built from a generator can be scanned twice (once to validate, once to insert) without the generator being exhausted after the first pass.

Four tests replace PR #1's one happy-path test: the happy path, the empty batch, a duplicate within the batch, and a duplicate against a job already in the queue — the two cases the original PR left untested, plus a check that both failure cases leave the queue completely unchanged:

```python
import unittest


class TestSubmitMany(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_happy_path_submits_all_in_order(self):
        q = JobQueue()
        jobs = q.submit_many([("a", {}, 1), ("b", {}, 5), ("c", {}, 0)])
        self.assertEqual([j.id for j in jobs], ["a", "b", "c"])
        self.assertEqual(q.pop_ready().id, "b")          # highest priority first, batch order aside

    def test_empty_batch_returns_empty_list(self):
        q = JobQueue()
        self.assertEqual(q.submit_many([]), [])
        self.assertEqual(q.counts(), {"pending": 0, "running": 0, "done": 0, "failed": 0})

    def test_duplicate_within_batch_submits_nothing(self):
        q = JobQueue()
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            q.submit_many([("a", {}, 0), ("b", {}, 0), ("a", {}, 0)])
        self.assertEqual(q.counts(), {"pending": 0, "running": 0, "done": 0, "failed": 0})

    def test_duplicate_against_existing_job_submits_nothing_new(self):
        q = JobQueue()
        q.submit("a", {})
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            q.submit_many([("b", {}, 0), ("a", {}, 0)])
        self.assertEqual(q.counts(), {"pending": 1, "running": 0, "done": 0, "failed": 0})
```

Running the repository's test command over this suite together with the existing `TestJobQueue` tests described in the Problem section (reconstructed below so the checks are self-contained) gives:

**Rewritten PR #1 description.**

> **Summary.** `submit_many` lets a caller submit a batch of `(job_id, payload, priority)` triples in one > call instead of looping over `submit`. Unlike that loop, the batch is atomic: it takes `self._lock` once > for the whole call, validates every id first, and either creates every job in the batch or, if any id > collides with an existing job or with an earlier item in the same batch, creates none of them and raises > `ValueError`. > > **Trade-offs.** Atomicity costs one extra pass over `items` to validate before inserting, and requires > materializing `items` into a list even if the caller passed a generator, so the whole batch is held in > memory at once. Neither cost is significant at the batch sizes this is for (startup backlog replay, a few > hundred jobs); a caller seeding a very large one-off backlog should chunk it rather than pass one huge > batch. > > **Test results.** `python -m unittest -v` passes, 9 tests / 0 failures, shown above; both new duplicate > cases additionally assert the queue is left unchanged. > > **Known limitations.** Atomicity is validated only within one process; two processes sharing state purely > through `save`/`load` files could still each accept the same id before either has written its file. The > error message on a collision does not say whether the clash was against an existing job or another item in > the same batch — fine for today's only caller (logging the batch and retrying), worth revisiting if a > caller needs to distinguish the two.

### Follow-ups

- A crash leaves some jobs `"running"` forever: `load` only re-queues `"pending"` jobs, by design, since a `"running"` job might genuinely still be in flight in another process. A supervisor that knows no worker survived the crash would need a separate `requeue_stuck(older_than)` call, not a change to `load` itself.
- `pop_ready` returning `None` immediately makes an idle worker either busy-poll or sleep between calls; the alternative, blocking inside `pop_ready` until a job is ready, trades that for a condition variable that every `submit` and `fail` must remember to notify.
- `self._lock` only protects threads inside one process; two processes both calling `save` against the same path, or one saving while another loads, can still interleave at the filesystem level and need their own coordination (a lock file, or a single process that owns the state file) that is out of scope for this module.
