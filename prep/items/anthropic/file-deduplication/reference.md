Two points are worth confirming before coding: whether a directory reached only through a symbolic link should be walked (here it is not — see Symbolic links above), and what the function returns when the tree has no duplicates at all (here, an empty list, never `None` and never a list padded with singletons).

### Part 1

A generator that walks the tree once and filters out symbolic links and non-regular entries keeps that policy in one place, so every later part can reuse it unchanged. `os.walk` does not follow a symbolic link to a directory on its own (`followlinks` defaults to `False`), so such a directory is already never descended into; a symbolic link to a file, though, still shows up in `os.walk`'s list of files and has to be filtered out explicitly with `os.path.islink`. Hashing streams every file through SHA-256 in fixed-size chunks rather than a single `f.read()`, so a multi-gigabyte file never has to fit in memory at once; an unreadable file raises inside that `open` or that `read`, which is caught and turned into a skip rather than a crash. Two files land in the same group exactly when their full-content digests match, which handles empty files without any special case at all — every empty file hashes to the same constant digest, so they collide automatically.

```python
import hashlib
import os
from collections import defaultdict

CHUNK_SIZE = 1 << 20   # 1 MiB per streamed read, so a huge file is never loaded into memory at once


def _iter_files(root_path: str):
    """Yields every regular, non-symlink file under root_path. A symbolic link -- to a file, to a
    directory, or dangling -- is never followed and never yielded, so a directory reached only through
    one is not walked into either."""
    for dirpath, _dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root_path):   # followlinks=False by default
        for name in filenames:
            path = os.path.join(dirpath, name)
            if os.path.islink(path) or not os.path.isfile(path):
                continue    # NOTE: islink() first -- isfile() alone would follow the symlink to decide
            yield path


def _hash_file(path: str) -> bytes | None:
    """Streams path through SHA-256 in fixed-size chunks. Returns None if it cannot be read."""
    hasher = hashlib.sha256()
    try:
        with open(path, "rb") as f:
            while chunk := f.read(CHUNK_SIZE):
                hasher.update(chunk)
    except OSError:
        return None      # NOTE: permission error or similar -- skip this file, never crash the walk
    return hasher.digest()


def find_duplicate_files(root_path: str) -> list[list[str]]:
    by_hash = defaultdict(list)
    for path in _iter_files(root_path):
        digest = _hash_file(path)
        if digest is not None:
            by_hash[digest].append(path)
    groups = [sorted(paths) for paths in by_hash.values() if len(paths) >= 2]
    groups.sort(key=lambda g: g[0])   # NOTE: groups ordered by their own (already-sorted) first path
    return groups
```

Every file in the tree is opened and hashed in full here, which is correct but wasteful: a `stat` call, or even a handful of bytes, is often already enough to prove two files differ, and this reads every byte of every one of them regardless.

### Part 2

Bucketing by size costs nothing beyond the walk `find_duplicate_files` already does: `os.path.getsize` reads filesystem metadata the operating system already has, never a file's content. Within a bucket of $m$ files sharing one size $s$, Part 1's approach reads $ms$ bytes no matter how many of them turn out to be duplicates. Sampling only the first $k$ bytes of each (`PREFIX_SIZE` below) costs $mk$ bytes and, for two files whose content differs anywhere in that first $k$-byte window — true of nearly any two unrelated files once $k$ is a few kilobytes — already proves them distinct, with no further reading. Only files whose sampled prefix collides go on to a full read; call that count $d$ (for a genuine duplicate group, $d$ is exactly its size; a coincidental prefix collision between otherwise different files is possible but, at four kilobytes, astronomically unlikely outside adversarially crafted input). Total bytes read is about $mk + ds$, against $ms$ for hashing everything: once $s \gg k$ and duplicates are rare ($d \ll m$), that is roughly an $s / k$-fold reduction for every file that turns out unique — a 1 GiB file sampled at 4,096 bytes is ruled out, once it can be, after reading about $2^{30} / 2^{12} = 2^{18} = 262{,}144$ times less of it than a full hash would.

```python
PREFIX_SIZE = 4096   # bytes sampled for the cheap pre-filter -- a filesystem block is a natural size


def _hash_prefix(path: str) -> bytes | None:
    """Hashes only the first PREFIX_SIZE bytes of path (the whole file, if it is shorter). Returns
    None if it cannot be read."""
    try:
        with open(path, "rb") as f:
            data = f.read(PREFIX_SIZE)
    except OSError:
        return None
    return hashlib.sha256(data).digest()


def find_duplicate_files_fast(root_path: str) -> list[list[str]]:
    by_size = defaultdict(list)
    for path in _iter_files(root_path):
        try:
            size = os.path.getsize(path)          # NOTE: metadata the OS already has -- no content read
        except OSError:
            continue                               # gone, or unreadable metadata: treat as unreadable
        by_size[size].append(path)

    by_prefix = defaultdict(list)
    for size, paths in by_size.items():
        if len(paths) < 2:
            continue                               # NOTE: tier 1 -- a size nothing else shares can't collide
        for path in paths:
            digest = _hash_prefix(path)
            if digest is not None:
                by_prefix[(size, digest)].append(path)

    groups = []
    for (_size, _prefix_digest), candidates in by_prefix.items():
        if len(candidates) < 2:
            continue                               # NOTE: tier 2 -- distinct prefixes already rule these out
        by_full = defaultdict(list)
        for path in candidates:
            digest = _hash_file(path)              # tier 3 -- only survivors pay for a full read
            if digest is not None:
                by_full[digest].append(path)
        groups.extend(paths for paths in by_full.values() if len(paths) >= 2)

    groups = [sorted(g) for g in groups]
    groups.sort(key=lambda g: g[0])
    return groups
```

If even a cryptographic collision at the full-hash tier is unacceptable — guarding against a file deliberately crafted to match another's SHA-256 digest, rather than an accident — add a fourth, final step: for each candidate group sharing `(size, full_hash)`, compare its files byte for byte (`filecmp.cmp(a, b, shallow=False)`, or an explicit chunked comparison) before accepting the group. That costs one more full read of files that are already, for all ordinary purposes, certain duplicates, so it is worth paying only when acting on a false merge would itself be costly, such as deleting one of the "duplicate" copies outright.

### Part 3

Reading a file blocks on the operating system while the data comes back from storage, and Python releases the GIL for the duration of a blocking system call, so several threads that are each waiting on their own read overlap almost perfectly — why `find_duplicate_files_concurrent` defaults to a thread pool. A process pool sidesteps the GIL entirely by using separate interpreters, at the cost of spawning workers and pickling arguments and results between them; that cost is worth paying once the work is genuinely CPU-bound with no I/O left to overlap, such as a slow, pure-Python hash function. Which regime a given machine and file set falls into is a question for a benchmark on the real target hardware, not for reasoning about it in the abstract. Because a disk's speed varies by machine and a benchmark on a shared or virtualised one can be noisy, the checks below isolate the concurrency mechanism itself — whether blocked workers really do let others proceed — from any particular disk's throughput, by substituting a fixed, artificial delay for the read and confirming wall time drops by close to the expected factor.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, ThreadPoolExecutor


def _hash_many(paths, hash_fn, max_workers, pool_cls) -> dict[str, bytes]:
    """Applies hash_fn to every path using a worker pool; returns {path: digest}, silently omitting
    paths that could not be read."""
    if not paths:
        return {}
    with pool_cls(max_workers=max_workers) as pool:
        digests = pool.map(hash_fn, paths)   # NOTE: map() preserves input order, so the zip below is safe
        return {path: digest for path, digest in zip(paths, digests) if digest is not None}


def find_duplicate_files_concurrent(root_path: str, max_workers: int | None = None,
                                     use_processes: bool = False) -> list[list[str]]:
    pool_cls = ProcessPoolExecutor if use_processes else ThreadPoolExecutor

    by_size = defaultdict(list)
    for path in _iter_files(root_path):
        try:
            by_size[os.path.getsize(path)].append(path)
        except OSError:
            continue
    tier1 = [(size, p) for size, paths in by_size.items() if len(paths) >= 2 for p in paths]

    prefixes = _hash_many([p for _, p in tier1], _hash_prefix, max_workers, pool_cls)
    by_prefix = defaultdict(list)
    for size, path in tier1:
        if path in prefixes:
            by_prefix[(size, prefixes[path])].append(path)

    tier3 = [(size, p) for (size, _pfx), paths in by_prefix.items() if len(paths) >= 2 for p in paths]
    fulls = _hash_many([p for _, p in tier3], _hash_file, max_workers, pool_cls)
    by_full = defaultdict(list)
    for size, path in tier3:
        if path in fulls:
            by_full[(size, fulls[path])].append(path)

    groups = [sorted(paths) for paths in by_full.values() if len(paths) >= 2]
    groups.sort(key=lambda g: g[0])
    return groups
```

`find_duplicate_files_concurrent` keeps the same three tiers as Part 2, but hashes every candidate of a given tier in one batch through the pool instead of one path at a time, so the parallelism spans the whole tree within each tier rather than being confined to one size or one prefix bucket at a time. Since `pool.map` returns results in the same order as its input regardless of which worker finishes first, and the grouping step sorts its output at the very end regardless of insertion order, the result never depends on timing — it is exactly `find_duplicate_files_fast`'s result, computed with more workers.

### Follow-ups

- **Hash choice.** SHA-256's accidental-collision probability, about $2^{-256}$, stays negligible even summed over far more files than a dedup tool will ever see, so trusting a `(size, hash)` match is safe in practice; MD5 is faster, but a deliberately constructed collision is already known and cheap to produce, which rules it out the moment the file contents cannot be trusted (a shared upload directory, say). BLAKE3 keeps that same resistance to a deliberate collision while running several times faster, using a tree structure that lets it use multiple cores and SIMD instructions on a single file; a non-cryptographic hash such as xxHash goes faster still by giving up that resistance entirely, a fine trade when the only adversary is chance.
- **A file changing during the scan.** A hash is not a snapshot: content that changes between the prefix read and the full read, or between one candidate's read and another's, can produce a wrong grouping. Guarding against it precisely needs OS-level support (a copy-on-write snapshot, or a lock the writer also respects); short of that, comparing a file's size and modification time, captured at listing time, against the same metadata read again just before trusting its hash catches most cases, at the cost of a re-scan for the files that moved.
- **All files the same size and huge.** If every file lands in one size bucket, every one of them must be hashed; the way to cut wasted work is to compare candidates chunk by chunk in lock-step and abandon a pair the moment one chunk differs, rather than hashing files that are going to turn out unequal all the way to the end.
- **Distributing across machines.** Shard the tree by size bucket (or by a hash of the size, if a few sizes dominate), send each shard to a worker, deduplicate within it exactly as above, and merge the resulting groups at the end — no worker ever needs to compare a file against one outside its own shard, since a duplicate always shares its size. A shard containing one very large size bucket becomes a straggler; splitting an oversized bucket further, by prefix hash, rebalances it.
- **Real-time detection.** Maintain a persistent index from `(size, full_hash)` to the paths sharing it, and use a filesystem-notification API (`inotify` on Linux, `fsnotify` elsewhere) to hash a file once it finishes being written rather than rescanning the tree; a write-completion event, not a write-start event, is what should trigger the hash, since the file is still changing until then.
