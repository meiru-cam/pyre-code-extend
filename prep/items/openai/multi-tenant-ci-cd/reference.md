One point worth confirming: whether every tenant needs the same isolation boundary — a customer on dedicated capacity can take a lighter one. This design assumes the harder case, one pool shared by tenants of unknown mutual trust.

### Requirements and scale

**Push and job rate.** 5,000 tenants pushing an average of 64 times a day give $320{,}000$ pushes/day, $320{,}000 / 86{,}400 \approx 3.7$ pushes/sec on average. At 7 jobs per workflow that is $2{,}240{,}000$ jobs/day, $\approx 25.9$ jobs/sec; at the 5x peak, $\approx 18.5$ pushes/sec and $\approx 129.6$ jobs/sec.

**Executor pool.** A job holds its node for the image pull, the run and the teardown, so Little's law, $L = \lambda \cdot W$, takes $W = 20 + 100 + 10 = 130$ s, not the 100 s runtime: $L = 129.6 \times 130 \approx 16{,}852$ jobs running at peak (about 3,370 on average). An execution node runs one job at a time, so the pool needs at least that many; with 20% headroom for nodes booting, draining, or failing a health check, $16{,}852 \times 1.2 \approx 20{,}222$, rounded up to **20,300 execution nodes**, which finish $20{,}300 / 130 \approx 156.2$ jobs/sec — $\approx 83\%$ utilization at peak.

**Status and log write volume.** Each job emits roughly 4 status changes (created, `queued`, `running`, a terminal one) and a log chunk every 2 s of its run ($100 / 2 = 50$) — 54 events per job, so $2{,}240{,}000 \times 54 \approx 1.21 \times 10^8$ events/day, $\approx 1{,}400$/sec on average and $\approx 7{,}000$/sec at peak. Only the status changes, $\approx 520$/sec at peak, write to the job store — fewer than lease renewals (a lease is held 120 s, so $129.6 \times 120 / 10 \approx 1{,}560$/sec at peak).

**Log storage.** Taking 80 KB of log text per job, $2{,}240{,}000$ jobs/day write $\approx 179.2$ GB/day, $\approx 2.51$ TB over 14 days of hot retention before logs move to archival storage.

### Data model and API

**Tenant** — `id`, `weight` (its plan's share of the pool), `max_running_jobs`, `running_jobs`.

**WorkflowRun** — `id`, `tenant_id`, `repo_id`, `commit_sha`, `status` (`pending | running | succeeded | failed | cancelled`).

**Job** — `id`, `workflow_run_id`, `tenant_id`, `name`, `image`, `command`, `status` (`pending | queued | running | succeeded | failed | cancelled`), `version` (bumped by every update of the row), `pending_deps` (count of upstream jobs not yet succeeded), `attempt_count`, `max_attempts`, `not_before` (earliest claim time after a retry), `cancel_requested`, `lease` (`{executor_id, lease_expires_at}`, present only while `running`), `fencing_token` (a per-job counter, bumped at every claim, never reset), `exit_code`, `blocked_by_job_id` (the upstream whose failure or cancellation cancelled this job).

**JobEdge** — `workflow_run_id`, `upstream_job_id`, `downstream_job_id` — the DAG's edges.

**Artifact** — `id`, `job_id`, `name`, `storage_uri`, `size_bytes`, `checksum` — a job's output files.

The DAG advances inside the transaction that ends an upstream job: when the `complete` call's compare-and-swap, conditioned on `fencing_token` and `status = 'running'`, changes a row, the same transaction runs, per downstream job, `UPDATE job SET pending_deps = pending_deps - 1 WHERE id = ? AND status = 'pending'`, then `UPDATE job SET status = 'queued' WHERE id = ? AND status = 'pending' AND pending_deps = 0`. The compare-and-swap succeeds once per job, so a resent or stale `complete` decrements nothing, a crash mid-transaction rolls it all back, and two upstreams finishing together serialize on the downstream row, so exactly one sees 0. A change-stream consumer doing this work instead would replay events after a crash and count an upstream twice, unless each edge carried a flag flipped in the decrement's transaction. A job ending `failed` or `cancelled` instead cancels, in the same transaction, every job downstream of it still `pending`, setting `blocked_by_job_id`; the `status = 'pending'` guards keep a cancelled job from being revived.

Core external API:

- `POST /hooks/push` — `{repo_id, commit_sha, ref}`. Parses that commit's workflow YAML, sorts it topologically (`422` on a cycle), and inserts one `WorkflowRun` and one `Job` per node in one transaction, `pending_deps` set to each job's upstream count and jobs with none already `queued`. Returns `202 {run_id, status: "pending"}`.
- `GET /runs/{run_id}` — the run's status and each job's status, `version`, attempt count and exit code: the snapshot the UI renders and checks live updates against.
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/stream` — a push channel, scoped to the caller's `tenant_id`, for this run's status and log-chunk events.
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/cancel` — one transaction cancels every `pending` or `queued` job and flags `cancel_requested` on `running` ones: the node sees the flag in its next heartbeat response and calls `fail` (`reason: "cancelled"`), and a flagged job whose lease lapses is cancelled, not requeued.
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/logs?since_offset=` — a byte range of the current attempt's log.

Internal, node-facing API — every call after `claim` carries the `fencing_token` it was issued and gets `409` once it is stale (Deep dive: scheduling):

- `POST /executors/{executor_id}/claim` → `{job_id, fencing_token, lease_expires_at, image, command, secret_refs, secrets_credential, artifact_refs}`, or `204` when nothing is ready.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/heartbeat` — `{fencing_token}` → `{lease_expires_at, cancel_requested}`.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/logs` — `{fencing_token, seq, chunk}` → stored in the object store under `logs/{job_id}/{fencing_token}/{seq}`, then announced.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/complete` — `{fencing_token, exit_code, artifact_manifest}` → `succeeded` on a zero exit code, `failed` otherwise, advancing the DAG in the same transaction; a resend after a lost response gets success if the row already holds this token's result.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/fail` — `{fencing_token, reason, retryable}` → the retry policy (Deep dive: scheduling).

    gateway --> client
```

A push reaches the API service's webhook, which writes the run and its jobs to the job store — the only authority on a job's state — in one transaction. The dispatcher tails the store's change stream and puts every job that turns `queued` into the ready queue, partitioned by tenant: a disposable index, rebuilt from the store if lost, where a duplicate entry is harmless because only the claim's compare-and-swap assigns a job. A free node asks the scheduler for work; the scheduler picks a tenant by weighted fair queuing and claims one of its jobs, returning a fencing token, a secrets credential and a 30-second lease (three heartbeat intervals). The node boots a microVM from the job's image, fetches its secrets, runs the command while sending heartbeats and log chunks, uploads its artifacts and calls `complete`. The same change stream feeds the realtime gateway, and the lease monitor scans every 5 s for lapsed leases and requeues their jobs.

### Deep dives

**Scheduling and the exactly-once commit.** Execution is only at-least-once: a node that loses its lease to a partition or a pause keeps running and may write a result after a second attempt took over. What is exactly-once is the commit of each job's result — its terminal status, exit code, artifact manifest and downstream decrements — however many attempts ran.

- *Lease timeout alone*: reassign once the lease lapses. Cheap, but a late write from the original attempt can still land after the new attempt's, since nothing tells a stale write from a current one.
- *Lease plus a fencing token on every write* (chosen): the claim's compare-and-swap (`status: 'queued' -> 'running'`) also bumps `fencing_token`, which every later call from that attempt carries: its write is `UPDATE ... WHERE id = ? AND fencing_token = ? AND status = 'running'`, so a requeued, superseded or finished attempt gets `409` in any arrival order. The monitor's requeue is conditional too, `WHERE id = ? AND status = 'running' AND lease_expires_at < now()` on the store's clock: a renewal that commits first wins, and a heartbeat arriving after the requeue gets `409`.

The object store cannot run that check, so the log call reads the token before writing, and an attempt fenced off in between still lands a chunk — under keys containing its own token, while the UI shows only the log of the token in the row.

The token protects the store, not the node's process: a node that cannot reach the store stops once its lease runs out by its own clock, one whose partition heals stops at its first `409`, and until then two attempts can run side by side. Compiling or testing twice is harmless: only the attempt whose `complete` commits counts. A deploy or a publish can reach the same external system from both attempts, so the platform passes every attempt an idempotency key derived from `job_id` alone — identical across attempts, so a system that deduplicates on it acts once — plus the `fencing_token`, for a system that can refuse a lower token than one it has seen. Making an arbitrary shell command idempotent is beyond the platform; it is the workflow author's job.

Retries: a retryable `fail` (an image-pull error, a failed health check) or a lapsed lease increments `attempt_count` and requeues the job with `not_before` set by a jittered backoff (5 s, then 10 s, ±20%); the third failure (`max_attempts = 3`) ends it `failed`. A job whose node stops heartbeating is therefore claimable again within $30 + 5 + 10 \times 1.2 = 47$ s of its last heartbeat, inside the 50 s target. A non-zero exit code is never retried: it is a correct result, not a fault.

**Tenant isolation.** The boundary has to survive a malicious job, not just a buggy one.

- *Plain containers* (namespaces and cgroups on the host kernel): fast to start and densely packed, but every job on a host shares that kernel, so one kernel or container-runtime escape reaches the other tenants' jobs on the host.
- *A microVM per job* (a Firecracker-style VM with its own guest kernel) (chosen): an escape must also break the hypervisor. Cost: boot time — well under a second for a minimal virtual machine monitor, small against the 130 s occupancy — and the memory each guest reserves for itself, so fewer jobs fit on a host.

Secrets (deploy keys, API tokens) are stored encrypted per tenant, never in the `Job` row or the ready queue. The claim returns only `secret_refs` — the secrets this workflow's definition names, not the tenant's whole vault — and a credential bound to `(job_id, fencing_token)`, which the secrets store honors only while the job store shows that token current and the job `running`. A queued job therefore has no credential and a stale attempt's is refused; the values live only inside that job's microVM and vanish with it.

Fair scheduling: one global FIFO would put a tenant's burst of thousands of jobs ahead of everyone else's. Instead each tenant has a virtual time that advances, per dispatched job, by the job's expected node-seconds (its recent average) divided by the tenant's `weight`, and the scheduler serves the backlogged tenant with the smallest one, kept in a heap — $O(\log \text{tenants})$ per dispatch. A tenant that becomes backlogged again resumes at no less than the smallest virtual time among those waiting, so idle time is not banked as credit. Fair queuing only decides who gets the *next* free node, and running jobs are never preempted, so a tenant pushing into an idle pool could still hold all of it for as long as its jobs run. A per-tenant cap bounds that: the claim transaction increments `running_jobs` only while it is below `max_running_jobs`, whichever transaction takes a job out of `running` decrements it, and a capped tenant leaves the heap until one of its jobs ends. Cost: a capped tenant's backlog waits even while nodes are idle. Virtual times are soft state in the scheduler; losing them only resets the fairness history.

**Real-time status.**

- *Polling* `GET /runs/{run_id}`: simple, but the 2 s target needs a poll about every second per open run, re-reading the full snapshot whether or not anything changed.
- *Push over a live connection* (chosen): a relay tails the job store's change stream and publishes each job change, `{run_id, job_id, version, status}`, to a pub/sub topic keyed by `run_id`; the gateway instance holding a client's `GET /runs/{run_id}/stream` connection subscribes and forwards it. Coming from the committed change rather than from the writer, the event survives a writer crashing right after its commit. A log chunk is announced as `{job_id, fencing_token, seq}` by the API that stored it, and the client fetches the bytes itself.

Delivery can still drop across a gateway restart or a reconnect, and can repeat or reorder, so the client never relies on it alone: on connect and reconnect it subscribes first, then calls `GET /runs/{run_id}`, and applies an event only if its `version` is newer than the one it holds for that job — a raced, duplicate or late event never moves the view backwards. With a critical path of three jobs (≈390 s per run), $18.5 \times 390 \approx 7{,}200$ runs are active at peak: even a viewer on each is only 7,200 mostly idle connections, and stateless gateways need no pinning, since any instance can subscribe to any topic.

### Follow-ups

- A build cache is an object keyed by the tenant plus a hash of its inputs (lockfile checksum, image digest, the step's command), read before a job runs and written back on a miss. Concurrent writers need no coordination, since a key is written atomically and either copy is valid; the tenant prefix keeps one tenant from reading or poisoning another's.
- A key can also skip a step instead of restoring its inputs: a unit-test job whose command, image digest and source tree hash to an earlier run's may report that run's result, which turns anything the key omits — a system package, a network response — from a slow rebuild into a wrong pass. Where the cache lives is the other trade-off: on the node's own disk a hit costs nothing but serves only the jobs that land there, so the scheduler can prefer, never require, a node that recently ran the same repo, while an object-store cache serves every node through a download a 130-second job may not earn back.
- To pass artifacts between jobs, each attempt uploads under a key containing its `fencing_token`, so it never overwrites the winner's; downstream jobs read only the `Artifact` rows the winning `complete` committed, by `(workflow_run_id, job_id)`, never another run's.
