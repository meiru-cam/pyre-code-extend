Worth confirming before designing: whether the grid is fully checked, i.e. every open cell belongs to exactly one across slot and one down slot. This design assumes a fully checked grid, the standard convention; an unchecked cell only removes some crossing constraints, a strict simplification of the same problem.

### Requirements and scale

**Why one machine can't brute-force it.** Indexing the dictionary by length narrows a slot's candidates from 1,000,000 words to those of its length — about 77,000 per length on average over 13 lengths, tens of thousands mid-range, fewer only at the extremes. Even at a deliberately low floor of 300 candidates for each of the ~100 slots, filling the board without checking any crossing has at least $300^{100} \approx 10^{248}$ combinations: not a runtime estimate, just proof that per-slot filtering alone gets nowhere near exhaustive search. The crossing-pruned tree is astronomically smaller, but nothing bounds its size in advance, and proving that no filling exists means visiting all of it; the design assumes a hard board outlasts one machine's five minutes, so the search must be both distributed and pruned early.

**Dictionary and index memory.** At an assumed average word length of 7 letters, the raw dictionary, as fixed-width records per length bucket, takes about $1{,}000{,}000 \times 7 = 7$ MB. The inverted index keeps one dense bitmap per (length, position, letter), one bit per word of that length — 26 bits per (word, position), so $26 \times 7{,}000{,}000 / 8 \approx 22.75$ MB — roughly 30 MB in all, small enough for every worker to load a full local copy at startup: no sharding, no per-candidate network round trip.

**Solve-request rate and concurrency.** $20{,}000$ requests/day average to $20{,}000 / 86{,}400 \approx 0.231$ requests/sec; at 5x that during the daily peak, $\approx 1.157$ requests/sec — an hour at that rate is about 4,167 requests, comfortably inside the daily total. Assume 90% of puzzles finish in about 15 s of search and the remaining 10% run the full 300 s give-up budget, for a weighted average solve time of $0.9 \times 15 + 0.1 \times 300 = 43.5$ s. By Little's law, $L = \lambda W$: on average $\approx 10.1$ puzzles are being solved concurrently, at peak $\approx 50.3$.

**Worker pool size.** The search is elastic — a hard puzzle will use every worker it is given, up to its cap — so the pool size is a budget: allow 8 workers per active puzzle on average. At peak, $50.3 \times 8 \approx 403$ workers are busy; with 20% headroom, rounded up to a multiple of the cap, the pool is **512 workers** ($403 / 512 \approx 79\%$ utilized at peak). At full 64-worker fan-out for the whole budget, one puzzle expands at most $64 \times 2{,}000 \times 300 = 38{,}400{,}000$ nodes (2,000 expansions/sec/worker is an assumption, not a measurement) — tens of millions, nowhere near the $10^{248}$ floor above: distribution alone buys at most a factor of 64, and the rest closes only once propagation collapses the branching factor.

**Task-queue throughput.** Assume a task lives about 0.5 s on average, claim to report, with a heartbeat every 7 s: $403 / 0.5 \approx 806$ claims/sec, as many reports, and $403 / 7 \approx 58$ heartbeats/sec — roughly 1,670 store writes/sec at peak, and at most about 265/sec for one 64-worker puzzle, whose rows share a single partition. Task granularity is bound by per-task overhead — a round trip plus a conditional write — against how little CPU one node expansion costs, not by aggregate throughput.

### Data model and API

**Puzzle** — `puzzle_id`, `width`, `height`, `dictionary_version`, `time_budget_seconds` (default 300), `status` (`queued | solving | solved | unsat | timeout`), `generation` (bumped when the puzzle is solved or times out; carried by every task so a stale worker can tell it should stop), `tasks_created`, `tasks_finalized` (changed only by the writes that insert or finalize tasks), `solution` (nullable, the finished `slot_id -> word` map), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

**Slot** — `slot_id`, `puzzle_id`, `start_row`, `start_col`, `direction` (`across | down`), `length`, `crossings` (`[{other_slot_id, this_position, other_position}]`, computed once at submission).

**Task** — `task_id`, `puzzle_id`, `generation`, `assignment` (the full partial `{slot_id: word}` map this task starts from — at most 100 entries, cheap to store whole), `slice` (`{slot_id, lo, hi}`: candidates `lo` to `hi - 1` of that slot, in word-id order; empty for the root), `status` (`ready | running | dead_end | split | solved`), `owner_worker_id`, `lease_expires_at`, `fencing_token` (bumped by every claim, never reused), `parent_task_id`.

**Worker** — `worker_id`, `status` (`idle | busy`), `current_task_id`, `last_heartbeat_at`.

Core APIs — external:

- `POST /puzzles` — `{width, height, slots, dictionary_version, time_budget_seconds}` → `{puzzle_id, status: "queued"}`; writes the `Puzzle`, its `Slot` rows, and a root `Task` with an empty assignment.
- `GET /puzzles/{puzzle_id}` — `{status, elapsed_seconds, tasks_created, tasks_finalized, active_workers}`.
- `GET /puzzles/{puzzle_id}/solution` — once `status = "solved"`, `{solution: [{slot_id, word}]}`.

Worker-facing — every call after `claim` carries the `fencing_token` it was issued; the store rejects a write whose token isn't the task's current one, or whose task is no longer `running`, with a `409`:

- `POST /workers/{worker_id}/claim` → `{task_id, generation, fencing_token, assignment, slice, split_into, deadline}`, or `204` if nothing is ready; `split_into` is how many more ready tasks the puzzle could use right now.
- `POST /tasks/{task_id}/heartbeat` — `{fencing_token}` → `{lease_expires_at, stop: bool, split_into}` (`stop` once the puzzle's generation has advanced past the task's).
- `POST /tasks/{task_id}/report` — `{fencing_token, outcome: "dead_end" | "solved" | "split", solution?, split?}`; a `split` (`{assignment, slot_id, ranges}`) finalizes the task and inserts one child per range in one transaction, the first already claimed by the reporter, whose new `task_id` and `fencing_token` it returns. A `solved` report is instead a compare-and-swap on the puzzle's `status`, whatever the token.

### Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    client[Client] --> api[API service]
    api --> store[(Puzzle & task store)]
    store -- dispatcher --> queue[[Task queue]]
    queue --> pool[Worker pool]
    pool --> store
    pool --> dict[(Dictionary index)]
    store -- on solved --> cancel[[Cancel channel]]
    cancel --> pool
    lease[Lease monitor] --> store
    lease --> queue
```

A submission is validated (slot bounds fit the board, crossings computed from shared cells) and written as a `Puzzle` row, its `Slot` rows, and a root `Task` before the API acknowledges the client — a crash between the two would otherwise let the client believe in a puzzle the store has no record of. A background dispatcher turns `ready` tasks into entries in the task queue, a disposable index workers pull from; the store stays authoritative. A worker claims a task, rebuilds its slice's candidates from the local index, and searches depth-first, at each level taking the open slot with the fewest candidates and skipping any candidate that would leave a crossing slot with none; whenever a claim or heartbeat reply carries `split_into > 0`, it hands the untried candidates at the shallowest level of its DFS stack back to the store as new tasks. Once a `solved` compare-and-swap succeeds, the puzzle's `generation` advances and a cancel goes out on the puzzle's channel; workers check a local stop flag every few hundred expansions, a missed message is caught by the next heartbeat (`stop: true`), and queued tasks can no longer be claimed, since a claim requires the puzzle to be `solving`. Meanwhile the lease monitor requeues any task whose lease expired without a heartbeat.

### Deep dives

**Task splitting and load balancing.** A task's assignment and slice carry everything a worker needs, so no search state is shared; the question is when and where to cut a running search apart.

- *Split by candidate count*: split whenever the slot a task branches on has more candidates than a threshold. Simple, but candidate count is a poor proxy for subtree size: a fresh puzzle's first slot, with a whole length bucket of candidates, floods the queue with tasks that each do a handful of expansions, while a slot with three candidates can hide a subtree that keeps one worker busy for the whole budget as the rest sit idle.
- *Split on demand, at the shallowest untried level* (chosen): work stealing, with the store as go-between. A worker splits only when its puzzle has fewer ready tasks than workers it could still use (free workers in the pool, up to its 64 cap), a shortfall claim and heartbeat replies carry as `split_into`. It cuts the untried candidates at the shallowest level of its DFS stack — the largest unexplored subtrees, with the most open slots below — into at most `split_into` contiguous `[lo, hi)` slices; the same write finalizes its task and adds one more child for the branch it is in the middle of, handed back to it already claimed, so its search goes on without a pause.

Cost: an idle worker can wait up to one heartbeat interval (7 s) for work, and every claim rebuilds its candidates, one AND per fixed crossing letter over the slot's length bucket (about 1,200 machine words for 77,000 words, about a microsecond each). In exchange, the search is cut as finely as idle workers require rather than by a guess at subtree size; the fan-out cap keeps one split from creating more ready tasks than the puzzle can run at once, so the queue never floods; and the no-repeated-word rule needs no shared registry, since excluding used ids takes only the task's own `assignment`.

**Pruning and slot ordering.** The board is a constraint satisfaction problem: variables are the slots, a variable's domain is its length's words filtered to agree with every letter a crossing slot has already fixed and to exclude used words, and a constraint ties two crossing slots to the same letter at their shared cell.

- *Fixed order*: simple, but a large, lightly-constrained slot gets tried first purely by position, doing real work before ever reaching a slot that would fail immediately.
- *Most-constrained-variable, MRV* (chosen): recompute every remaining slot's candidate count and pick the smallest before each assignment, so a zero-candidate slot is pruned the moment it exists, not whenever a fixed order reaches it. Cost: at every node, one AND per fixed crossing letter for every open slot, each over that slot's length bucket — a few hundred bitmap operations for ~100 open slots.

Look-ahead is a separate axis: *plain backtracking* only checks a new word against already-fixed crossings, discovering a starved neighbor only when its own turn comes up; *forward checking* (chosen) checks every unassigned neighbor's count before committing and discards a candidate that would empty one — exactly what MRV would catch one call later anyway, so it saves that recursive call, and its candidate generation, per pruned branch. *Maintaining arc consistency* goes further, repeatedly dropping from every open slot the words whose letter at a crossing no longer occurs among the crossing slot's candidates. It sees a dead end two slots away before trying the candidates of the slot in between, so it visits fewer nodes, but costs up to 52 bitmap operations per crossing per pass (an AND and an OR per letter) instead of one; whether that pays off at 1,000,000 words needs measuring on real boards, so the design starts from forward checking.

On one small, fully crossed 5×5 board with a synthetic 310-word dictionary, MRV with forward checking visits 12.6x fewer nodes than a fixed interleaved order without it, all of it from MRV: once MRV is in place, forward checking removes calls, not nodes. The ratio belongs to that board; eight dictionaries built the same way give 9x to 19x.

**Fault tolerance and completeness.** Two invariants must hold under crashes: no subtree is silently dropped, and "no filling exists" is declared only once every subtree has been explored.

- *Lease timeout alone*: the lease monitor requeues a task whose lease expired. Cheap, but a merely paused worker can still report later on a task a second worker has meanwhile claimed or finalized — one task's completion recorded twice, or a split's children created twice.
- *Fencing token on every write* (chosen): a claim is a compare-and-swap from `ready` to `running` that bumps `fencing_token`; a later write lands only while its token is current and the task `running`. A stale worker's report gets `409` and is discarded: its CPU is wasted, but re-exploring a subtree changes no count, because only one report per task can land.

Why "no filling exists" is then sound: the root covers the whole search space, and a split replaces a task's unexplored part by children that partition it exactly, in the same transaction that marks the parent `split`, so every unexplored part always belongs to a task still `ready` or `running`. Each finalizing write adds one to `tasks_finalized` and lands at most once per task, so the counter counts distinct tasks; the write that brings it level with `tasks_created` leaves no task open, and also moves the puzzle from `solving` to `unsat` by compare-and-swap. Both conditions carry weight: finalizing a parent before inserting its children lets the counters agree, briefly or after a crash, with the children missing; and a second report counted for one task stands in for another still running. A puzzle's counters and tasks share one partition, so each such write is a single-partition transaction.

The coordinator — dispatcher and lease monitor — keeps no state of its own: a replacement rebuilds the queue from `ready` rows, and two instances overlapping during failover can at worst enqueue a task twice or both requeue it, harmless because claim and requeue are compare-and-swaps on the task row. A `solved` report instead wins on a puzzle-level compare-and-swap regardless of its token, once the store has re-checked every crossing: a valid filling is valid whichever attempt found it. A crash-reassigned task restarts from its `assignment` and `slice`, losing what its owner explored since claiming or last splitting it. A puzzle that exhausts its budget first is marked `timeout`, not `unsat`, via the same generation bump as a solved one: the two statuses tell a caller whether "no filling" was proven or merely not disproven yet.

### Follow-ups

- Stochastic local search (simulated annealing, or a min-conflicts hill climb) run alongside the distributed search can find a filling faster on many satisfiable boards, but it never proves one unsatisfiable, so the exhaustive search still has to finish, or the budget expire, before the service reports "no filling exists."
- A task's candidate ranges are only meaningful against the exact dictionary index they were computed from, so `dictionary_version` is pinned at submission; a mid-solve swap would silently point old ranges at different words.
- The 64-worker cap only bounds one puzzle's claim; at peak, dozens of puzzles could each want that many at once, so sharing the pool fairly across puzzles, not just tasks within one, would need weighted scheduling by priority or age.
- A task requeued after a crash re-searches whatever its owner covered since claiming it. Most tasks are far too short for that to matter, but a long one heartbeats, and the conditional write that renews its lease can also advance `slice.lo` past the top-level candidates it has finished, capping the redo at one heartbeat interval.
- A slot whose length has no words in the dictionary is rejected at submission with an immediate `unsat`, without creating a root task.
