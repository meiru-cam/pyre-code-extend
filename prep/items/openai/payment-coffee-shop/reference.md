Two points worth confirming before designing: what happens when a final amount would exceed the 120% ceiling, and whether a declined hold may be retried under the same order. Assumed here: in both cases the register opens a fresh order, voiding the old hold in the first case.

### Requirements and scale

**Order volume and hold QPS.** $S = 2{,}000$ stores at 400 orders/store/day give $800{,}000$ orders/day chain-wide, an average of $800{,}000 / 86{,}400 \approx 9.3$ QPS on the hold path. About 40% of a store's volume falls inside its 2-hour morning rush; taking every store's rush to fall in the same two hours — an overestimate for a chain spread across time zones — $0.40 \times 800{,}000 = 320{,}000$ orders land in a 7,200 s window, a peak rate of $320{,}000 / 7{,}200 \approx 44.4$ QPS. A 1.3x margin for bursts inside that window gives a design target of about 58 QPS for the online tier — round up to 60 for headroom.

**Ledger, storage, and batch size.** 97% of the day's holds are captured, 2% voided, 1% expire, so $776{,}000$ payments/day reach `captured`; each posts two ledger rows, $1{,}552{,}000$ rows/day. At ~200 and ~120 bytes/row that is about 54 GiB/year of payment data and 63 GiB/year of ledger data, before indexes and replication. Split across 5 merchant accounts, a normal night's captures average $155{,}200$ rows/account, about 14.8 MiB per settlement file at ~100 bytes/row — none of it large: the system is bound by correctness and latency, not by data volume.

### Data model and API

**Order** — `order_id`, `store_id`, `register_id`, `final_amount_minor`, `currency`, `created_at`, `order_status` (`open | completed | cancelled`).

**Payment** — `payment_id`, `order_id` (at most one non-terminal payment per order, enforced by a partial unique index), `store_id`, `psp_account_id`, `psp_hold_id`, `psp_capture_id` (null until captured), `hold_amount_minor`, `capture_amount_minor` (null until a capture is requested), `currency`, `state`, `idempotency_key_hold` (unique), `hold_created_at`, `hold_expires_at`, `captured_at`, `batch_id` (null until `settling`), `settled_at`, `updated_at`. Besides that unique index, a composite `(state, hold_expires_at)` serves the expiry sweep and `(state, psp_account_id, captured_at)` serves the nightly batch's claim of one account's `captured` rows, so neither has to scan the whole table.

**Ledger entry** — `entry_id`, `posting_key`, `payment_id` (null for batch-level postings), `account`, `direction` (`debit | credit`), `amount_minor`, `currency`, `created_at`. Rows are append-only; a correction is a new posting. `posting_key` names the event behind a posting (`capture:<payment_id>`, `payout:<batch_id>`, `refund:<refund_id>`, ...), and a unique index on `(posting_key, account)` makes every posting idempotent. A capture's pair is written in the same transaction as its `authorized → captured` update — ledger rows live on the payment's shard, so no distributed transaction is needed. A \$4.75 capture of a \$4.00 hold (a \$0.75 tip) debits `psp_receivable` 475, the asset "the PSP owes us", and credits `store_card_sales` 475, a per-store clearing account the chain's accounting system (out of scope) splits into revenue, sales tax, and tips.

**Settlement batch** — `batch_id`, `business_date`, `psp_account_id`, `cutoff_at`, `state` (`building | submitted | reconciled | failed`), `file_reference` (derived from `batch_id`, so it is known before submission), row counts and totals at claim and after reconciliation (`claimed_*`, `reconciled_*`), `submitted_at`, `reconciled_at`; the unique index on `(business_date, psp_account_id)` is the batch's own idempotency key.

**State machine.** Each transition is one conditional update, `UPDATE payments SET state = <to>, <fields> WHERE payment_id = ? AND state = <from> AND <extra>`; the table lists only the fields and the extra condition (the batch claim updates every matching row at once).

- Transition: → `pending` · Trigger: hold request arrives · Actor: payment service · PSP call: none (called after the insert) · Fields; extra condition: `INSERT`; unique `idempotency_key_hold`
- Transition: `pending` → `authorized` · Trigger: PSP approves (reply, lookup or webhook) · Actor: payment service · PSP call: `create_hold` · Fields; extra condition: `psp_hold_id`, `hold_expires_at`
- Transition: `pending` → `failed` · Trigger: PSP declines, or confirms no hold exists · Actor: payment service · PSP call: `create_hold` or lookup · Fields; extra condition: —
- Transition: `authorized` → `captured` · Trigger: PSP confirms the capture · Actor: payment service · PSP call: `capture` · Fields; extra condition: `psp_capture_id`, `captured_at`; `capture_amount_minor IS NOT NULL`
- Transition: `authorized` → `voided` · Trigger: cashier cancels · Actor: payment service · PSP call: `void` (after the update) · Fields; extra condition: `capture_amount_minor IS NULL`
- Transition: `authorized` → `expired` · Trigger: 6 minutes without a capture · Actor: expiry sweep · PSP call: `void` (after the update) · Fields; extra condition: `capture_amount_minor IS NULL AND hold_expires_at < now()`
- Transition: `captured` → `settling` · Trigger: batch claim · Actor: batch job · PSP call: none · Fields; extra condition: `batch_id`; `psp_account_id = ? AND captured_at < cutoff_at`
- Transition: `settling` → `settled` · Trigger: PSP report lists the row · Actor: reconciliation job · PSP call: none · Fields; extra condition: `settled_at`; `batch_id = ?`
- Transition: `settling` → `captured` · Trigger: dropped from the file, file rejected, or PSP confirms it unsettled · Actor: batch or reconciliation job · PSP call: none · Fields; extra condition: `batch_id = NULL`; `batch_id = ?`

A capture first checks the amount against 120% of `hold_amount_minor`, writes `capture_amount_minor` under the condition `state = 'authorized' AND capture_amount_minor IS NULL`, and only then calls the PSP, retrying until the PSP answers. A void goes the other way round: the update comes first, so a capture that arrives afterwards fails its guard instead of racing the PSP void, which is then retried until acknowledged (voiding is safe to repeat). Zero affected rows means the caller re-reads the row: already in the target state (with the same amount) is a duplicate, answered with the stored result; any other state is a conflict or a stale event, logged and rejected. No application-level locking is needed.

**Idempotency.** The hold call carries an `idempotency_key` that the register generates once per order and keeps in local storage, so even a retry after a reboot reuses it. It is stored as the payment's unique `idempotency_key_hold`; a repeat finds the existing payment and returns its current state instead of calling the PSP again. A capture needs no separate key: the two guards above already admit one amount and one capture per hold. Every outbound PSP call carries a key too (`idempotency_key_hold` for the hold, `payment_id` for capture and void), and because the `pending` row is committed before the hold call, a crash between the PSP accepting a request and our recording it leaves only a `pending` row, for the timeout lookup to resolve.

PSP webhooks can be delivered more than once, out of order, or after our own lookup has already resolved the payment. Each is deduplicated by inserting its `psp_event_id` into an events table under a unique index, in the same transaction as the conditional update it triggers — done separately, a crash between the two would mark the event as seen while losing its effect. A stale "authorized" webhook that meets an already `captured` payment therefore fails its precondition and is discarded instead of rewinding the state.

Core APIs:

- `POST /orders/{order_id}/hold` — body `{register_id, amount_minor, currency, card_token, idempotency_key}`; returns `{payment_id, state, psp_hold_id, hold_expires_at}`, `{state: "failed", decline_reason}`, or, when the outcome is unknown, `{payment_id, state: "pending"}`.
- `POST /payments/{payment_id}/capture` — body `{final_amount_minor}`; returns `{state, capture_amount_minor, psp_capture_id}` (`state` stays `authorized` while the PSP capture is still being retried).
- `POST /payments/{payment_id}/void` — body `{reason}`; returns `{state: "voided"}`.
- `GET /payments/{payment_id}` — status read, for the register's UI and support tooling.
- `POST /internal/settlement-batches` — starts or resumes tonight's batch for one PSP account; body `{business_date, psp_account_id}` (idempotent on that pair), called by the nightly scheduler.

```

A hold request from the register (`pos`) reaches the payment API, which inserts a `pending` payment, calls the PSP through the PSP executor, and records the answer in the payments DB before replying; a PSP that resolves a hold asynchronously instead sends its webhook to the webhook receiver, driving the same transition. A ready drink triggers a capture over the same route, moving the payment to `captured` and posting its two ledger rows in the same transaction. The expiry sweep runs on its own, handling holds past `hold_expires_at` and `pending` rows left unresolved. Every night the settlement batch claims `captured` rows and submits one file per PSP account through the executor; the PSP's settlement report arrives the next business day, and reconciliation marks rows settled and posts the payout and any mismatch to the ledger.

### Deep dives

**Sync authorization, async settlement, and a PSP timeout.** The hold call could block the register until the PSP round trip finishes, or accept the request and push the answer back later over a separate channel. This design keeps it synchronous: the 1.5 s p99 budget leaves about 300 ms beyond the PSP's own 1.2 s p99 for our writes, and routing the confirmation through a queue adds exactly the kind of delay that gets worse under load, right when the register can least afford it; only work nobody is watching in real time (webhook handling, capture and void retries, the nightly batch) goes async.

The hard case is a hold call that times out (the PSP call's timeout is about 1.3 s, so fewer than 1% of calls reach this path): the request was sent but no answer came back, so whether the PSP created the hold is unknown; a blind retry is only as safe as the PSP's deduplication of the key, and giving up risks abandoning a real hold. On a timeout, the payment service first looks the request up at the PSP by `idempotency_key_hold`: a found hold is adopted (`authorized`), a decline is recorded (`failed`), and only a "no such request" answer clears the way to resend the create call under the same key. If the lookup itself times out, only the lookup is retried, with backoff, never the create call. If the outcome is still unknown after a few seconds, the register receives `pending` and the cashier can take another card under a fresh order; the expiry sweep keeps retrying the lookup, adopts a hold it finds (and voids it once the 6 minutes pass without a capture), and marks the payment `failed` only when the PSP confirms there is no hold. A request delayed in transit can still create the hold after that answer: its "authorized" webhook then meets a `failed` payment, and the handler voids the stray hold rather than discarding the event.

**Partial failure and rerun of the nightly batch.** One all-or-nothing transaction per file is simple but lets a single bad row (a currency mismatch, an amount above the ceiling) block that account's whole night; committing row by row avoids that but makes "did the batch finish" hard to answer. Here the batch, not the row, is the unit of retry, and a bad row is returned to `captured` and reported instead of blocking the file. Each step is safe to rerun after a crash:

- **Create or resume.** `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` the `building` batch with its `cutoff_at`. A rerun that finds an existing `building` batch first asks the PSP whether its `file_reference` was already received (an unanswered check is retried, never skipped); if it was, the rerun only marks the batch `submitted`.
- **Claim.** The claim update runs on every shard; a rerun matches no row already in `settling`, and the stored `cutoff_at` keeps it from pulling in later captures.
- **Generate and submit.** The file is built from the rows tagged with `batch_id`, sorted by `payment_id`, so every rerun produces the same file under the same reference.
- **Mark submitted.** `UPDATE settlement_batches SET state = 'submitted' WHERE batch_id = ? AND state = 'building'`; after that no rerun claims or submits again. A file the PSP rejects outright marks the batch `failed` and returns its rows to `captured` for the next night.

Reconciliation, the next business day, runs per PSP account: it diffs that account's report against the rows that account's batch claimed, by `(psp_capture_id, amount)`, and the matched amounts less fees have to equal the single deposit that acquiring bank made for the day. Rolled into one chain-wide total, an account short by exactly what another is over would disappear. A matched row moves to `settled` through its own conditional update, so a rerun skips it. A claimed row missing from the report stays `settling` and is looked up at the PSP; it returns to `captured` only once the PSP confirms it was not settled — resubmitting it on a guess could settle it twice. A report row with no claim (a duplicate capture our checks should have stopped, or a manual PSP-side adjustment) is posted to a `suspense` account, keyed by the report row's id, and opens an investigation. The payout is one posting per batch, keyed `payout:<batch_id>`: debit `bank_cash` (net) and `psp_fees` (the fee), credit `psp_receivable` (gross).

**Consistency, sharding, and PSP resilience.** Payment and ledger rows need strong consistency: every transition commits on its shard's primary with a synchronous replica, so a failover never loses a committed capture, and every decision that depends on state (capture, void, batch claim) reads the primary, never an asynchronous replica that may lag.

At ~60 QPS and ~120 GiB a year, one primary can carry the whole chain; the sharding key matters for growth, and is a real trade-off. Two dimensions that come up first are unavailable here: the card's issuing bank, which this system cannot name at all — only a PSP token reaches it, never a card number or a BIN — and the cardholder, who has no account in an in-store flow. That leaves `payment_id` and `store_id`. `payment_id` spreads writes perfectly evenly but scatters one store's rows across every shard, turning a single-store statement or a store's clearing-account balance into a scatter-gather. `store_id` keeps them on one shard — a store with ten times the average traffic is still nowhere near a shard's ceiling — at the cost of uneven shard sizes, absorbed by hashing `store_id` into a fixed number of buckets, several stores per bucket. That favors `store_id`.

When a PSP is slow or unreachable, a circuit breaker trips on a rolling error rate (say, more than 20% failures over the last 50 calls), so holds fail fast instead of each waiting out a 1.3 s timeout; below that threshold, transient errors get a bounded exponential backoff. Once the breaker trips, new holds go to the backup PSP — but only new ones: an authorization belongs to the PSP (and its acquiring bank) that obtained it, so only that PSP can capture or void it; the backup has no record of it. A capture for a hold at the primary is therefore retried against the primary until it recovers — the issuer keeps the authorization valid for days, far longer than the chain's 6-minute policy — and the expiry sweep skips any payment whose capture is already requested.

### Follow-ups

- Scaled up to 10,000 authorizations/s (864,000,000 a day), one account's nightly file would reach 15.6 GiB: cut it into parts of 100,000 rows, sorted by `payment_id`, about 1,700 of them, and record each part's index on the batch row as the PSP accepts it, so a rerun resumes at the next part and `submitted` is still set exactly once, at the end.
- A refund, unlike a void, returns money that was already captured: it gets its own `refund:<refund_id>` posting (debit `store_card_sales`, credit `psp_receivable`) and settles as its own line in a later batch, never by mutating the original captured row, whose batch may already be reconciled.
