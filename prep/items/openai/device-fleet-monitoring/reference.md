One point worth confirming before designing: whether a device that has been offline for a long stretch should, on reconnect, get every command it missed, or only the ones still inside their execution window (assumed the latter — a command whose window has already passed no longer helps the grid, so it is simply never delivered to that device and later expires for it).

### Requirements and scale

**Uplink rate and bandwidth.** $N = 4{,}000{,}000$ devices reporting every $H_b = 40$ s give a baseline rate of $N / H_b = 100{,}000$ reports/sec. At roughly 300 bytes on the wire per report (device id, sequence number, event time, a handful of metric fields, plus protocol framing), baseline bandwidth is $100{,}000 \times 300\text{ B} = 30$ MB/s. Persisted rows drop the framing, at roughly 220 bytes each: $100{,}000 \times 220\text{ B} \times 86{,}400\text{ s} \approx 1.90$ TB/day of raw telemetry. Kept 14 days — long enough to recompute a report, short enough to bound cost — that is $\approx 26.6$ TB.

**Peak during an active command.** A single demand-response event can target up to 800,000 thermostats (40% of that tier) at once. While a command is active, the targeted devices report every 10 s instead of 40 s: extra rate $= 800{,}000 \times (1/10 - 1/40) = 60{,}000$/sec, for a peak of $160{,}000$ reports/sec ($48$ MB/s) — on top of, not instead of, the baseline from the rest of the fleet.

**Thundering herd on reconnect.** A shared failure — a substation trip, an ISP outage — can take 10% of the fleet, 400,000 devices, offline together. Reconnecting the instant power returns, with no spreading, would cluster on the order of 5 seconds, an $80{,}000$/sec burst. Each device instead waits a jittered delay drawn uniformly from a 200-second window before its first reconnect attempt, which spreads the same 400,000 devices to $400{,}000 / 200 = 2{,}000$ connections/sec. Budgeting 250 handshake-and-auth completions/sec per instance, that takes $\lceil 2{,}000/250 \rceil = 8$ instances, 10 with the usual 15% burst margin — versus $\lceil 80{,}000/250 \rceil = 320$, 368 with margin, for the unjittered burst, 36.8 times as many. Little's law, $L = \lambda W$, shows this is a throughput problem rather than a concurrency one: even the raw 80,000/sec burst, at a 20 ms handshake, holds only $L = 80{,}000 \times 0.02 = 1{,}600$ handshakes in flight at once — a small number of slots, arriving far faster than any reasonably sized pool can retire them.

**Offline backlog on reconnect.** Each device caches locally while offline, up to 8 hours of reports at the baseline rate ($8 \times 3{,}600 / 40 = 720$ records) before the oldest is dropped. Sizing against a 4-hour outage, each of the 400,000 affected devices comes back carrying up to $4 \times 3{,}600/40 = 360$ cached records, a $400{,}000 \times 360 = 144{,}000{,}000$-record backlog platform-wide. Paced to drain over 1 hour rather than dumped all at once, that adds $144\times10^6 / 3{,}600 = 40{,}000$ records/sec. In the worst case — one outage both caused the herd and triggered the demand-response event still active as the backlog drains — all three add: $100{,}000 + 60{,}000 + 40{,}000 = 200{,}000$ records/sec, $60$ MB/s, the number the ingestion tier is sized against.

**A command batch's completion breakdown.** For the 800,000-device event above: 760,000 (95%) are online at dispatch and get delivered; the other 40,000 stay offline for the whole window and never do. Of the delivered, 80% accept (608,000), 15% refuse outright (114,000), and 5% neither accept nor refuse before the window ends (38,000, still open). Of the 608,000 that accepted, 520,000 have reported completion by the time a dispatcher checks 5 minutes after the window closes; the other 88,000 have no completion report yet. Storage for per-command delivery rows is small next to raw telemetry: at roughly 500 commands/day averaging 50,000 targeted devices, $500 \times 50{,}000 \times 150\text{ B} \times 30\text{ days} \approx 112.5$ GB for 30 days of history.

### Data model and API

**Device** — `device_id`, `device_type` (`ev_charger | thermostat | cold_storage | critical_load`), `control_tier` (`delay_tolerant | comfort_band | short_time | non_interruptible` — `critical_load` is always `non_interruptible`), `region_id`, `last_seq` (the high-water mark used to reject stale reports), `last_commanded_at` (for fairness rotation), `registered_at`.

**Presence** — `device_id`, `lease_deadline`, `session_node` (which gateway instance currently holds the session). Kept in a fast shared store, not per-gateway memory, so any instance can answer "is this device online" and a crashed gateway's devices read as offline the moment their lease lapses, with no separate cleanup step.

**TelemetryRecord** — `device_id`, `seq` (assigned by the device, monotonic, persisted across reboots), `event_time`, `received_at`, `metric_type`, `payload`. Unique `(device_id, seq)` makes a re-uploaded batch idempotent — inserting an already-stored record is a no-op — and is what `Device.last_seq` is advanced from (deep dive (c)).

**Command** — `command_id`, `region_id`, `device_type` (optional — if given, restricts selection to that one type/tier, as in the worked example above; if omitted, creation fills `target_count` by walking control tiers in priority order, deep dive (b)), `target_count` (how many devices the command should reach), `directive` (`{type: "reduce_power_pct", value, duration_min}`), `created_at`, `expires_at` (`created_at + duration_min`), `finalize_at` (`expires_at +` a 4-hour correction horizon), `status` (`open | finalized`). Selection happens once, at creation, into a fixed device list, so a device registered afterward never joins a command already running.

**CommandDelivery** — `command_id`, `device_id` (unique pair — creating a command's rows is one bulk insert per target device, idempotent the same way), `state` (`undelivered | delivered | accepted | rejected | executing | completed | expired`), `last_event_time`, `updated_at`. Index `(command_id, state)` serves the status query's `GROUP BY`; index `(device_id, state)` where state is non-terminal serves "what does this device still owe a response on."

Core APIs:

- `POST /commands` — `{region_id, device_type?, target_count, directive, duration_min}` → `{command_id, target_count, expires_at}`. Rejected if it would select any `non_interruptible` device.
- `POST /devices/{device_id}/telemetry:batch` — `{records: [{seq, event_time, metric_type, payload}, ...]}` → `{accepted, duplicate}`. What a device sends on reconnect to flush its offline cache.
- `POST /devices/{device_id}/commands/{command_id}/ack` — `{state, event_time}`, where `state` is one of `delivered | accepted | rejected | executing | completed` → `{applied: bool, current_state}`. `applied` is false when the guard (deep dive (b)) rejects the transition as stale.
- `GET /commands/{command_id}/status?as_of=now|final` → per-state counts, derived rates (`coverage_rate`, `acceptance_rate`, `rejection_rate`, `completion_rate`), `realized_reduction_kw` (summed from `completed` devices' own before/after power-draw telemetry, not just their count), and `is_final`.
- `PATCH /commands/{command_id}` — `{action: "cancel"}` — immediately expires every still-`undelivered` row and best-effort notifies every targeted device that is online to stand down; whether they do is up to them.

A device holds one persistent, bidirectional session with the gateway tier (a protocol built for full-duplex push, such as MQTT or a gRPC stream, rather than a request the device has to poll) — the same session carries its heartbeats, its telemetry, its command acks upward, and any command pushed to it downward. Every inbound message refreshes that device's lease in the presence store and lands on the ingest queue, a durable, replayable log. From there, raw records are persisted to the telemetry store, and anything tagged with a `command_id` is also handed to the reconciler, which applies the guarded state-machine update (deep dive (b)) to the command-and-delivery store. On the way down, the dispatcher scans that same store for rows still `undelivered` (or `delivered` past a nominal decision window) whose device the presence store shows online, and pushes the directive through the gateway to the device's live session; a device found offline is left alone, and its row waits for the next scan after that device's session reopens. The console reads aggregated counts and the realized reduction straight from the delivery and telemetry stores to show a command's progress and to inform the next round's targets, and every state transition the reconciler applies is also written to an append-only audit log that alerting watches for anomalies (deep dive (c)).

### Deep dives

**Presence detection and the reconnect herd.** A 120-second lease (three missed 40-second reports) absorbs an ordinary retransmit delay without flapping a device online/offline, and still notices a genuinely disconnected device within two minutes. On reconnect after a mass outage, jittering each device's first attempt over a window (200 s here) turns an unbounded instantaneous spike into a bounded rate. The same jitter mechanism, and the same 250/sec-per-instance budget, cover a gateway instance's own crash: its devices' leases lapse, and their reconnects spread the same way rather than all landing on the instant of failover.

**Targeted dispatch, the confirmation state machine, and fairness.** Selection happens once, at creation, so the `target_count` in the response means the same fixed set of devices for the command's whole life. The worked example pins `device_type: thermostat`, so creation simply draws `target_count` thermostats from that one region and tier. Leaving `device_type` out asks for capacity without caring which kind of device supplies it — an operator shedding load region-wide rather than tier by tier — and creation then walks control tiers in priority order: it fills `target_count` from `delay_tolerant` devices first, then `comfort_band`, and only reaches `short_time` devices if the first two tiers can't supply enough; `non_interruptible` devices are never eligible either way (the API rejects any request that would select one). Within whichever tier is being drawn from, devices with the oldest `last_commanded_at` are preferred, so the same subset isn't hit every round; a device is skipped for 2 hours after being commanded; only when its tier runs short of devices off cooldown are the least recently commanded ones reused rather than leaving the target unmet.

Dispatch is a burst, not a trickle: 99% of the 760,000 devices online at dispatch have to be reached inside the 2-second target, $0.99 \times 760{,}000 / 2 = 376{,}200$ pushes/sec and about 75 MB/s at roughly 200 bytes per push — 3.8x the steady 100,000/sec uplink the same gateway fleet is carrying. That is affordable only because each push rides a session that is already open, and because dispatch workers shard the row scan by `device_id` so the fan-out spreads over the whole fleet instead of queueing behind one scanner.

Delivery state is a ladder — `undelivered < delivered < accepted < executing < completed` — plus two side exits. An update is applied only along a legal edge: the ladder only moves forward (an `executing` report arriving before its `accepted` report still advances the row straight to `executing`, backfilling the skipped step at the same `event_time` for audit — which step got skipped only says which of the device's own reports arrived first); `rejected` is the side exit reachable from any non-terminal state — modeling both a refusal and an owner revoking mid-execution — but it is the one edge the ladder's own ordering does not guard, so it is applied only when its `event_time` is at least the row's `last_event_time`; otherwise it is a refusal some newer report has already overtaken, and dropping it is what keeps the rule "an older state never overwrites a newer one" true on this edge too. Once a row is `completed` or `rejected` it accepts no further update. `expired` is not one of the states a device can ack: it is written once, by a sweep at `finalize_at`, to every row for that command still short of `completed` or `rejected`, which is also what turns the command's `status` to `finalized`. Revoking a command (`PATCH .../cancel`) expires its `undelivered` rows immediately and best-effort notifies every targeted device that is online, the `undelivered` ones included — a row still reading `undelivered` may be a push whose ack has not landed yet, and that device is exactly the one that would otherwise carry out a cancelled command. A device already `executing` is free to keep going or to stop; the platform only learns which by whatever it reports next.

**Correctable aggregation from duplicate, out-of-order and late reports.** Every report a device sends carries its own monotonically increasing `seq` and the `event_time` the device stamped it with. Presence and any per-device aggregate apply an update only if its `seq` is newer than the one already recorded, so a retried batch upload, a duplicate delivered twice by the network, or one message that overtakes another in flight can never push a newer value back to an older one — the guard depends on the device's own ordering, not on arrival order, which the network makes no promises about. `event_time` is read off the device's own clock, which is why every report also carries that clock's reading: the gateway keeps a smoothed per-device offset — `received_at` minus that reading — and normalizes `event_time` by it before any window test, so a device whose clock is minutes off does not get an on-time completion scored as late. A command-level report is a live count over `CommandDelivery` grouped by `state`, tagged `is_final = now >= finalize_at` rather than a separately stored snapshot, so there is exactly one place a number can be wrong, not two kept in sync.

Continuing the 800,000-device batch from the requirements section: at the 5-minute-after-window check, the completion count stands at $520{,}000 / 800{,}000 = 65.0\%$, with 88,000 devices still `accepted` or `executing` and no completion report yet, many of them among the 400,000 caught in the same outage and only just back online. Over the following 4 hours, 27,200 of those 88,000 send a completion report whose `event_time` still falls inside the 30-minute window — the *action* happened on time; only the *report* of it was late — correcting completion to $547{,}200/800{,}000 = 68.4\%$, up 3.4 points, while the rest never do and are swept to `expired` when `finalize_at` arrives. A completion report whose `event_time` falls after the window closed is not counted as `completed` however promptly it arrives — the device really did act too late to matter for this command.

### Follow-ups

- A device that disputes a command it never actually saw (network loss, not a refusal) has no way to tell the platform that from `undelivered` — from its side, nothing happened, so there's nothing to report; the dispatcher only sees the eventual `expired`, indistinguishable from a device that was simply never asked.
- Fairness cooldowns are per device; once enough history has accumulated, selection could also be weighted by a device's *realized* reduction from past commands, not just how recently it was picked.

Recomputes every number the prose states — the rates, the reconnect herd, the dispatch burst and the completion-rate walkthrough — from the same inputs, so a later edit to one cannot silently leave another stale.
