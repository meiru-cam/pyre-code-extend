Worth confirming before answering: whether "labeled data" means sentence-pair labels (entailment/contradiction) or query-passage judgments, since they feed the model differently. The answer below covers both.

### (a) Training the embedding model

The objective is contrastive: pull a query's embedding toward a passage that answers it and push it away from passages that do not. Serving ranks passages by embedding similarity to the query, so this trains the very quantity nearest-neighbor search will sort by, rather than training a classifier and only then comparing its embeddings.

The loss is InfoNCE. For an anchor (here a query) $q$, its positive passage $p^+$, and $N$ negative passages $\lbrace p_1^-, \dots, p_N^- \rbrace$:

$$L_{\text{InfoNCE}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(q, p^+) / \tau)}{\exp(\mathrm{sim}(q, p^+) / \tau) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \exp(\mathrm{sim}(q, p_i^-) / \tau)}$$

`sim(·,·)` is cosine similarity between L2-normalized embeddings, bounded to $[-1, 1]$, so the temperature $\tau$ carries the softmax's entire scale. The denominator sums the positive *and* every negative, which makes the loss exactly an $(N+1)$-way cross-entropy over `sim / τ` with the positive as the correct class.

In-batch negatives are close to free: each anchor's positive is already encoded to compute its own term, so the other $B - 1$ positives in a batch of size $B$ double as negatives with no extra encoder passes — only a $B \times B$ similarity matrix over embeddings that already exist. Each anchor therefore gets $N = B - 1$ negatives, with $B$ as large as memory allows (hundreds to thousands), plus a few mined hard negatives: DPR adds one per question, and every anchor is contrasted with the whole batch's hard negatives, not just its own.

Doubling the batch size changes only the summation: $N$ grows from $B - 1$ to $2B - 1$ while the positive term is untouched. The loss value itself goes up — a model that cannot tell the candidates apart scores $\log(N + 1) = \log B$, so doubling $B$ adds $\log 2$ — so losses at different batch sizes are not comparable. Quality improves because the in-batch sum is a sampled stand-in for a softmax over the whole corpus: a larger sample approximates it better and is likelier to contain a hard negative by chance. Mined hard negatives join the same summation, chosen for high similarity rather than at random; softmax weights each negative by its own similarity, so one such term can carry most of the negative-side gradient, and a few hard negatives teach more per step than many easy ones.

The gradient with respect to a negative's similarity is its softmax probability divided by $\tau$, so two negatives' gradients differ by a factor $\exp(\Delta\mathrm{sim} / \tau)$. As an illustration, take a positive at cosine similarity 0.75 and negatives at 0.68, 0.40, 0.10 and -0.10: at $\tau = 0.07$ the 0.68 negative alone holds 98.2% of the negative-side probability mass and its gradient is about 69,000x the easiest negative's; at $\tau = 0.20$ its share is 75.7%, at $\tau = 0.02$ effectively 100%. Too low a temperature makes the gradient ignore every negative but the closest one, so training becomes highly sensitive to that one candidate being a false negative (a relevant passage labeled as a negative); too high a temperature weights all negatives almost equally, so the near-misses that most need separating get little more push than unrelated passages. Fixed values between 0.01 and 0.1 are typical (SimCSE uses 0.05); $\tau$ can also be a learned parameter, as in CLIP.

Positive pairs with no labels use SimCSE's trick: pass the same text through the encoder twice; dropout is stochastic per forward pass, so the two embeddings differ slightly for identical input, and that pair counts as positive — an augmentation that cannot change meaning, unlike paraphrasing. With NLI-style sentence-pair labels, supervised SimCSE takes each premise's entailment hypothesis as its positive and the contradiction hypothesis written for the same premise as a hard negative — topically and lexically close but wrong, a signal random in-batch text rarely gives; neutral hypotheses are left unused. With question-passage data, the positive is (question, passage containing the answer), and DPR mines hard negatives by running BM25 on the question and keeping top-ranked passages that match its words but do not contain the answer. In this product the click logs are the largest source of such pairs: a clicked passage is a positive for its query, and passages shown above it but skipped are hard-negative candidates.

False negatives arise among mined and in-batch negatives alike — a duplicate passage, or a second document that also answers the question — and training against one pushes a correct answer away from the query. Mitigations: drop mined candidates that score implausibly close to the labeled positive; de-duplicate near-identical passages within a batch; and, once a reranker exists, drop any mined negative that it also scores highly.

### (b) Retrieval flow

The path: encode the query once with the bi-encoder, take the top few hundred passages from an approximate nearest-neighbor index while BM25 runs in parallel over the same passages, fuse the two lists by rank, and pass the top K — the shortlist — to a reranker.

A bi-encoder encodes queries and passages independently, so every passage embedding is computed once, offline. A cross-encoder concatenates query and passage and runs them jointly so every layer attends across the pair — more accurate, but nothing is precomputable, and scoring the corpus would take $4 \times 10^7$ forward passes per query. Hence the split: the bi-encoder for recall at corpus scale, the cross-encoder for precision at shortlist scale.

Exact search touches all $4 \times 10^7$ vectors for every query; an approximate index visits a small fraction of them at a small, tunable recall loss. Standard choices: IVF (coarse clusters, search only the nearest few), usually paired with product quantization, and graph indexes such as HNSW (each vector a node with edges to nearby vectors, search walking edges toward the query). HNSW is the better default: a strong recall/latency curve without retraining cluster centroids as passages keep arriving, at the cost of more memory per vector (graph edges plus near-full-precision vectors) than IVF+PQ's compressed codes. The main knob is search breadth — `efSearch`, the size of HNSW's candidate queue (`nprobe`, the number of clusters probed, plays the same role for IVF): it trades recall for latency at query time without a rebuild, and is set by measuring recall against exact search on a sample of queries.

Dense retrieval generalizes across paraphrase but struggles with exact tokens such as an acronym, a version number, or an identifier that a keyword query names directly; sparse (BM25) retrieval is the reverse. With half this traffic behaving like keyword search, dense retrieval alone is not enough: running both on every query and merging their lists covers both failure modes.

The two scores live on different scales — cosine is bounded, BM25 is unbounded and length-dependent — so reciprocal rank fusion uses only rank, not score:

$$\text{score}(x) = \sum_{r \in \lbrace \text{dense}, \text{sparse} \rbrace} \frac{1}{k_0 + \text{rank}_r(x)}$$

where rank 1 is the best and a passage missing from a list contributes nothing for it. The constant ($k_0 = 60$ in the original paper) flattens the top of each list so that agreement outweighs one retriever's favorite: a passage ranked 10th by both scores $2/70$, more than the $1/61$ of one ranked 1st by a single retriever, whereas with $k_0 = 0$ it would lose, 0.2 to 1. A weighted sum of per-query normalized scores keeps the actual score gaps and can do better when tuned, but its weight needs retuning whenever the query mix or either retriever changes, so rank fusion is the default.

Late interaction, as in ColBERT, keeps one embedding per token (query and passage alike) instead of one pooled vector, and scores a pair by MaxSim — for every query token, its best match among the passage's tokens, summed:

$$\text{score}(q, p) = \sum_{i} \max_{j} \; u_i \cdot v_j$$

where $u_i$ are the query's token embeddings and $v_j$ the passage's, normalized so each dot product is a cosine. Unlike the cross-encoder, passage-side token embeddings are still computed offline; unlike the bi-encoder, each query token is matched to whichever passage token fits it best, catching a phrase or entity a single pooled vector can average away. The cost is storage — about 300 vectors per passage here, $1.2 \times 10^{10}$ in all instead of $4 \times 10^7$, which is why ColBERT uses a small per-token dimension (128) and ColBERTv2 compresses the token vectors further — and a two-step search: a nearest-neighbor lookup per query token over all token vectors to collect candidate passages, then exact MaxSim over each candidate's tokens. It is worth that infrastructure only when fine-grained phrase matching matters, not as a default replacement for the bi-encoder.

### (c) Ranking

Retrieval scores come from models cheap enough to run over the whole corpus, hence coarser than a model that reads query and passage jointly; reranking spends that costlier model only on the shortlist, where it is affordable.

The reranker is a cross-encoder, scored pointwise — one independent forward pass per (query, candidate) pair, batchable and linear in the shortlist size; the cost is that a pointwise score cannot see or penalize redundancy across candidates the way scoring the whole shortlist in one pass could. A workable split of the 150 ms median is about 10 ms to encode the query, 30 ms for the two retrievers in parallel plus fusion, and 10 ms of network overhead, leaving up to 90 ms for the reranker — on the order of 100 candidates for a small cross-encoder on a GPU, a figure to measure rather than assume; the 350 ms 95th-percentile target absorbs queueing and slow index shards.

Its training data differs from the embedding model's: the embedding model only ever sees a positive against negatives with no notion of "how much better," while the reranker trains on graded labels — the human judgments not held out for evaluation, and click logs corrected for position bias: a click at rank 5 is stronger evidence than one at rank 1, since far fewer users look that far down, so raw click rate is divided by an estimate of how often each position is examined before it counts as a relevance label.

The reranker can only reorder what it is given: if the best passage never enters the shortlist, no reranking recovers it. Its ceiling is the retrieval stage's recall@K at the shortlist size K, which is why hybrid retrieval and a generous K matter more than sharpening an already-accurate reranker, and why recall@K on the shortlist is tracked separately from the reranker's own metrics.

K comes from the curve of recall@K against K on the evaluation set: take the point where it flattens, capped by what the reranker's latency, roughly linear in K, allows. Too small and relevant passages never reach the reranker; too large and latency is spent on candidates that add no recall.

### (d) Evaluation and iteration

Retrieval and the final list are graded differently. Recall@k — the fraction of a query's relevant passages that appear in the top k, averaged over queries — suits retrieval because it ignores order within the top k, and the reranker will reorder the shortlist anyway. MRR (the reciprocal rank of the first relevant result, averaged over queries) and nDCG@k are order-sensitive and belong to the list actually shown, since where the best result lands is what the user experiences. nDCG uses the 0-3 grade $g_i$ of the result at position $i$ rather than a binary label, in the common exponential form $\text{DCG@}k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (2^{g_i} - 1) / \log_2(i + 1)$, divided by the DCG of the ideal ordering so that a perfect list scores 1.

The roughly 20,000 human judgments are the small, unbiased anchor. They are split by query: a fixed share of the queries, covering keyword-style and natural-language queries alike, becomes the frozen evaluation set, kept out of every training and hard-negative-mining pipeline and re-run on every model or index change; the rest can train the reranker. Click logs supply a far larger but noisier second set: queries sampled from real traffic, labels from clicks corrected for the position bias above, with the examination estimate coming from a small slice of traffic shown in randomized order.

Online, the signals that matter are click-through rate at the top position, a same-session reformulation rate (an immediate related query signals the first answer failed), and a zero-result or no-click rate. None of these confirms that the clicked passage answered the question, only that it looked promising, so they supplement rather than replace the offline judgments.

Aggregate metrics can hide a regression in one segment offset by an improvement elsewhere, so metrics are tracked split by query type and corpus area. The frozen evaluation set is re-run nightly against the production index and model rather than only at deploy time, which catches a regression no model change caused — an index rebuild silently dropping a shard — before it shows up as slow drift in the online signals. A frozen set cannot see the queries themselves changing, so each quarterly annotation round samples fresh queries from recent traffic, and a widening gap between the metrics on that fresh slice and on the frozen set is the sign of drift.

### Follow-ups

- Triplet loss, $\max(0, m + \mathrm{sim}(q, p^-) - \mathrm{sim}(q, p^+))$ with a fixed margin $m$, sees one negative at a time: its gradient with respect to the two similarities is a constant $\pm 1$ while the margin is violated and zero otherwise, and each triplet ignores the rest of the batch. InfoNCE's softmax instead gives every negative in the batch a gradient that grows with its similarity.
- Distilling a cross-encoder's scores into the bi-encoder — the reranker as teacher, its scores as soft labels for extra training pairs — sharpens retrieval itself without touching serving latency.
- Gradient accumulation does not substitute for a larger batch here: negatives come only from examples encoded together, so each micro-batch still contrasts against its own few. Gathering embeddings across devices before computing the loss does enlarge the negative pool.
