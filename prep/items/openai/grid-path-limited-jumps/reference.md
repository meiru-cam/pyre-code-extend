Implement Part 1 first and get it fully checked before touching anything else — the later parts only add a table or a dimension to the same recurrence, and debugging all of them at once is much harder than debugging the score first.

### Part 1

Let $dp[i][j][k]$ be the largest base score of a path that starts at $(i, j)$ and ends at row $N - 1$, using at most $k$ further special moves. At the last row there is nothing left to do: $dp[N-1][j][k] = board[N-1][j]$ for every $j, k$. Otherwise the path's first move fixes the rest:

$$dp[i][j][k] = board[i][j] + \max\Bigl(\{\, dp[i{+}1][j{+}\delta][k] : \delta \in \{-1,0,1\},\ 0 \le j{+}\delta < M \,\} \ \cup\ \{\, dp[i{+}2][j][k{-}1] : k \ge 1,\ i{+}2 \le N{-}1 \,\}\Bigr).$$

The answer is $dp[0][p][K]$. There are $N \cdot M \cdot (K+1)$ states and each does $O(1)$ work, so this is $O(N M K)$ time and space.

```python
def _best_scores(board, K):
    """dp[i][j][k]: max base score of a path from (i, j) to row N - 1, using at
    most k more special moves."""
    N, M = len(board), len(board[0])
    dp = [[[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(N)]
    for j in range(M):
        for k in range(K + 1):
            dp[N - 1][j][k] = board[N - 1][j]
    for i in range(N - 2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(M):
            for k in range(K + 1):
                candidates = [dp[i + 1][j + dj][k] for dj in (-1, 0, 1) if 0 <= j + dj < M]
                if k > 0 and i + 2 <= N - 1:              # NOTE: excludes i == N-2, where i+2 == N is outside the grid
                    candidates.append(dp[i + 2][j][k - 1])
                dp[i][j][k] = board[i][j] + max(candidates)   # NOTE: dj = 0 is always in range, candidates is never empty
    return dp


def max_score(board, p, K):
    return _best_scores(board, K)[0][p][K]
```

### Part 2

Rebuild the path forward from `(0, p, K)`. At a state `(i, j, k)`, list its possible next states in ascending `(row, column)` order — the three steps by increasing column, then the special move, which always has the larger row — and take the first one whose `dp` value shows it still reaches the overall optimum, i.e. `board[i][j] + dp[next] == dp[i][j][k]`. Some next state always qualifies, since `dp[i][j][k]` was itself defined as a maximum over exactly these candidates. Choosing the smallest qualifying next cell at every step gives the lexicographically smallest optimal path. Take any other optimal path and the first position where the two differ — neither can be a proper prefix of the other, since every path stops the first time it reaches row $N - 1$. The shared prefix fixes the current cell and how many special moves have been used, so both paths are at the same state there; the other path's next cell qualifies too, because the rest of an optimal path is optimal from that state; and the greedy rule took the smallest qualifying cell, so the greedy path is the smaller of the two.

```python
def optimal_path(board, p, K):
    dp = _best_scores(board, K)
    N, M = len(board), len(board[0])
    i, j, k = 0, p, K
    path = [(0, p)]
    while i != N - 1:
        moves = [(i + 1, j + dj, k) for dj in (-1, 0, 1) if 0 <= j + dj < M]
        if k > 0 and i + 2 <= N - 1:
            moves.append((i + 2, j, k - 1))
        # NOTE: `moves` is already in ascending (row, column) order, so the first
        # one that keeps the score optimal is the lexicographically smallest choice
        for (ni, nj, nk) in moves:
            if board[i][j] + dp[ni][nj][nk] == dp[i][j][k]:
                i, j, k = ni, nj, nk
                break
        path.append((i, j))
    return path
```

### Part 3

Extend the same recurrence with a parallel table $cnt[i][j][k]$: the number of optimal-from-here paths, modulo $10^9+7$. The base case is $cnt[N-1][j][k] = 1$. For $i < N - 1$, among the same candidate next states as in Part 1, let $S$ be the ones that actually attain $dp[i][j][k]$; then $cnt[i][j][k] = \sum_{s \in S} cnt[s] \bmod (10^9+7)$. The membership test for $S$ compares the exact (possibly negative) scores computed in Part 1 — reducing a score modulo $10^9+7$ before comparing it could make a strictly smaller score look equal to the best one, or even larger, so only the running counts, never the scores, are ever taken modulo $10^9+7$.

```python
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7


def count_optimal_paths(board, p, K):
    N, M = len(board), len(board[0])
    dp = [[[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(N)]
    cnt = [[[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(N)]
    for j in range(M):
        for k in range(K + 1):
            dp[N - 1][j][k] = board[N - 1][j]
            cnt[N - 1][j][k] = 1
    for i in range(N - 2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(M):
            for k in range(K + 1):
                moves = [(i + 1, j + dj, k) for dj in (-1, 0, 1) if 0 <= j + dj < M]
                if k > 0 and i + 2 <= N - 1:
                    moves.append((i + 2, j, k - 1))
                best, total = None, 0
                for (ni, nj, nk) in moves:
                    val = dp[ni][nj][nk]
                    if best is None or val > best:       # NOTE: strict '>' — a new best discards the old tie count
                        best, total = val, cnt[ni][nj][nk]
                    elif val == best:                     # NOTE: compare the real (possibly negative) scores, never
                        total = (total + cnt[ni][nj][nk]) % MOD  #      `% MOD`-reduced ones; only `total` is reduced
                dp[i][j][k] = board[i][j] + best
                cnt[i][j][k] = total
    return cnt[0][p][K]
```

### Part 4

Consider step $t$ of a path, the move out of $(i, j)$, so $v_{t-1} = board[i][j]$ and $v_t = w$ is the value of the cell it lands on. Its pair bonus depends only on these two values, both read directly off the board. Its triple bonus also involves $v_{t-2}$, the value visited just before $(i, j)$, but only through the one comparison $v_{t-2} < board[i][j]$; the other half, $board[i][j] < w$, uses values already on hand. So the state needs one extra bit — not the path so far, not the previous cell's position, not even its value: $u = 1$ if the cell visited right before $(i, j)$ has a smaller value than $board[i][j]$, and $u = 0$ otherwise, including at the start, where there is no earlier cell. Any two partial paths that reach $(i, j)$ with the same $k$ and $u$ collect exactly the same bonuses from then on, so merging them loses nothing. Let $g[i][j][k][u]$ be the largest score (base plus bonuses) of a path from $(i, j)$ to row $N - 1$ using at most $k$ more special moves, with $g[N-1][j][k][u] = board[N-1][j]$. For a move to a candidate $(i', j', k')$ of Part 1, write $w = board[i'][j']$ and $u' = [board[i][j] < w]$, the bit that state starts with (a bracketed condition is 1 when it holds and 0 otherwise):

$$g[i][j][k][u] = board[i][j] + \max_{(i',j',k')} \Bigl( X \cdot [board[i][j] = w] + Y \cdot u \cdot u' + g[i'][j'][k'][u'] \Bigr).$$

The answer is $g[0][p][K][0]$. The table is twice the size of Part 1's, so this is still $O(NMK)$ time and space. Keeping the previous value itself in the state instead of $u$ is also correct, since the value determines $u$; it only splits states that behave identically.

```python
def max_score_with_bonuses(board, p, K, X, Y):
    """g[i][j][k][u]: max base score plus bonuses of a path from (i, j) to row N - 1,
    using at most k more special moves, where u = 1 iff the cell visited just before
    (i, j) has a smaller value than (i, j)."""
    N, M = len(board), len(board[0])
    g = [[[[0, 0] for _ in range(K + 1)] for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(N)]
    for j in range(M):
        for k in range(K + 1):
            g[N - 1][j][k] = [board[N - 1][j], board[N - 1][j]]
    for i in range(N - 2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(M):
            cur = board[i][j]
            for k in range(K + 1):
                moves = [(i + 1, j + dj, k) for dj in (-1, 0, 1) if 0 <= j + dj < M]
                if k > 0 and i + 2 <= N - 1:
                    moves.append((i + 2, j, k - 1))
                for u in (0, 1):
                    best = None
                    for (ni, nj, nk) in moves:
                        nxt = board[ni][nj]
                        up = 1 if cur < nxt else 0     # NOTE: this is the next cell's u
                        cand = g[ni][nj][nk][up] + (X if cur == nxt else 0) + (Y if u and up else 0)
                        if best is None or cand > best:
                            best = cand
                    g[i][j][k][u] = cur + best
    return g[0][p][K][0]   # NOTE: u = 0 at the start: no earlier cell, so no triple can end at t = 1
```

### Follow-ups

- Let `p` range over every starting column and take the best: Part 1's table already holds `dp[0][j][K]` for every `j`, so the answer is their maximum at no extra cost.
- Row `i` of the table reads only rows `i + 1` and `i + 2`, so keeping three rolling layers cuts the space of Parts 1, 3 and 4 to $O(MK)$; Part 2 still needs the whole table to walk forward.
- For `K` close to `N`, cap it at `(N - 1) // 2` first: a path descends `N - 1` rows and each special move takes two of them, so no path can use more.
- Requiring the path to end at a given column `q` only changes the base case: `dp[N-1][j][k]` becomes `board[N-1][q]` for `j = q` and `-inf` for every other `j`, and an answer of `-inf` means no path ends there.
