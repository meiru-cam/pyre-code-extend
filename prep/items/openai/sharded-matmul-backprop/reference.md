Two things worth confirming with the interviewer: which axis of $W$ is split first, and whether $X$ starts out replicated or already sharded (the derivation below is symmetric either way, only the transposes move to the other side). Writing `all_gather` and `all_reduce` as two separate functions, so that every exchange of data goes through one of them and nowhere else, is what makes shape-tracing in Part 3 possible.

### Part 1

Write $\bar A = \partial L / \partial A$ for any array $A$.

**Column-parallel.** Device $k$ holds $W_k$, the $k$-th block of columns of $W$, shape `(d_in, d_out_k)`, and a full copy of $X$.

$$Y_k = X W_k \quad (B \times d_{out,k}), \qquad Y = \operatorname{all\_gather}_{\mathrm{axis}=1}(Y_0, \dots, Y_{n-1}).$$

No communication is needed to produce $Y_k$ itself; the gather is only needed where the full $Y$ must live on every device. Slice the given $\bar Y$ locally into $\bar Y_k$ (device $k$'s columns) and apply the product rule to $Y_k = X W_k$:

$$\bar W_k = X^\top \bar Y_k \quad \text{(local)}, \qquad \bar X = \sum_k \bar Y_k W_k^\top = \operatorname{all\_reduce}\bigl(\bar Y_k W_k^\top\bigr).$$

$X$ feeds every device's local product, so its gradient is a sum over devices — an all-reduce.

**Row-parallel.** Device $k$ holds $W_k$, the $k$-th block of rows of $W$, shape `(d_in_k, d_out)`, and $X_k$, the matching block of columns of $X$, shape `(B, d_in_k)`.

$$Y_k = X_k W_k \quad \text{(a partial sum, shape } B \times d_{out}\text{)}, \qquad Y = \sum_k Y_k = \operatorname{all\_reduce}(Y_0, \dots, Y_{n-1}).$$

Here $Y_k$ already has the right shape but is only part of the answer, so the forward pass itself needs an all-reduce. Given the full $\bar Y$, identical on every device once that reduction has run:

$$\bar W_k = X_k^\top \bar Y \quad \text{(local)}, \qquad \bar X_k = \bar Y W_k^\top \quad \text{(local; device } k\text{'s own shard of } \bar X\text{)}.$$

Both gradients are local: $X_k$ and $W_k$ are each used by exactly one device, so nothing needs combining.

### Part 2

```python
import numpy as np


def all_gather(shards, axis):
    """shards[k]: device k's piece of the full array along `axis`. Returns, for every device, the
    same fully assembled array."""
    full = np.concatenate(shards, axis=axis)
    return [full for _ in shards]


def all_reduce(shards):
    """shards[k]: device k's partial sum, all the same shape. Returns, for every device, the same
    elementwise sum across all the shards."""
    total = sum(shards)        # NOTE: given only a gather, this is a gather on a fresh axis plus a local sum
    return [total for _ in shards]


def column_parallel_forward(X, W_shards):
    return [X @ Wk for Wk in W_shards]              # NOTE: X is replicated; no communication here


def column_parallel_backward(X, W_shards, dY_shards):
    dW_shards = [X.T @ dYk for dYk in dY_shards]                       # local
    dX_partial = [dYk @ Wk.T for dYk, Wk in zip(dY_shards, W_shards)]
    return dW_shards, all_reduce(dX_partial)                           # NOTE: sum over devices


def row_parallel_forward(X_shards, W_shards):
    Y_partial = [Xk @ Wk for Xk, Wk in zip(X_shards, W_shards)]
    return all_reduce(Y_partial)                     # NOTE: forward itself needs a reduction


def row_parallel_backward(X_shards, W_shards, dY):
    dW_shards = [Xk.T @ dY for Xk in X_shards]        # local
    dX_shards = [dY @ Wk.T for Wk in W_shards]        # local
    return dW_shards, dX_shards
```

Sharding uses `np.array_split(A, n, axis=...)`, which spreads a non-divisible size as evenly as possible (widths $3, 2, 2$ for `d_out = 7`, $n = 3$); calling it on $X$'s feature axis with the same $n$ for row-parallel guarantees $X_k$ and $W_k$ agree on `d_in_k`. The checks at the end confirm both schemes against an unsharded reference and against `torch.autograd`, in `float64`, for even and uneven splits alike.

### Part 3

The rows follow the order in which the bugs surface: each output is what `check_gradients()` prints once the bugs of the rows above it are fixed.

- Already fixed: nothing · Output of `check_gradients()`: `ValueError: matmul: ... (size 2 is different from 3)`, raised in `layer2_forward` · Points to: `shard_rows` cuts at other boundaries than `shard_columns`
- Already fixed: row 1 · Output of `check_gradients()`: `ValueError: ... along dimension 0, the array at index 0 has size 3 and the array at index 1 has size 2`, raised where `dW1_shards` are concatenated · Points to: the transpose in `dW1` is swapped
- Already fixed: rows 1–2 · Output of `check_gradients()`: errors `Y` 1.01, `dW1` 0.50, `dW2` 0.20, `dX` 0.28 · Points to: the forward result is already wrong: `layer2_forward` lacks its all-reduce
- Already fixed: rows 1–3 · Output of `check_gradients()`: `Y` and `dW2` exact to `1e-16`; `dW1` 0.77, `dX` 0.31 · Points to: only what passes through `layer1_backward` is wrong: the activation derivative
- Already fixed: rows 1–4 · Output of `check_gradients()`: `Y`, `dW1`, `dW2` exact; `dX` 0.29 · Points to: $\bar X$ alone is wrong: nothing sums it across devices
- Already fixed: all five · Output of `check_gradients()`: all four errors at most `1e-16` · Points to: —

**Shard boundaries disagree.** `shard_columns` uses `np.array_split`, giving hidden-dimension widths $3, 2, 2$ for `D_HIDDEN = 7`, $n = 3$. `shard_rows`, used for $W_2$, instead floor-divides ($7 \mathbin{//} 3 = 2$) into fixed chunks of 2, covering only 6 of the 7 rows and never matching $W_1$'s column boundaries. Device 0's $H_0$ has 3 columns from $W_1$'s split, but $W_{2,0}$ has only 2 rows from the mismatched split, so $H_0 @ W_{2,0}$ fails on its first call, inside the row-parallel forward pass.

```py
def shard_rows(A, n):
    return np.array_split(A, n, axis=0)      # same split function as shard_columns, only the axis differs
```

**Transpose swapped.** For $Y = AB$, $\bar B = A^\top \bar Y$; here $Y_k = X W_{1,k}$, so $\bar W_{1,k} = X^\top \bar Z_{1,k}$, shape `(d_in, hidden_k)`. The buggy $\bar Z_{1,k}^\top X$ computes the transpose of that, shape `(hidden_k, d_in)`. The three `hidden_k` widths are unequal (3, 2, 2), so concatenating the three wrongly-shaped pieces along `axis=1` fails outright, catching the bug with a shape error instead of silently producing a wrong-shaped `dW1`.

```py
dW1_shards = [X.T @ dZ1k for dZ1k in dZ1_shards]     # (d_in, hidden_k), matches W1_shards[k]
```

**Missing all-reduce.** Row-parallel forward computes only a partial sum $Y_k = H_k W_{2,k}$ per device; $Y = \sum_k Y_k$ needs summing across devices, exactly what `all_reduce` does. Skipping it leaves each device with just its own term, roughly $1/n$ of $Y$ in magnitude, and every downstream quantity — $\bar Y$, both weight gradients, $\bar X$ — inherits the same error, since all are computed from this wrong $Y$. Shapes match, so nothing raises.

```py
def layer2_forward(H_shards, W2_shards):
    Y_partial = [Hk @ W2k for Hk, W2k in zip(H_shards, W2_shards)]
    return all_reduce(Y_partial)      # row-parallel forward: sum the partial products across devices
```

**Activation gradient uses the wrong tensor.** `layer1_backward` computes $\bar Z_1 = \bar H \odot \tanh'(Z_1)$. The correct derivative $\tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh(z)^2 = 1 - h^2$ is a function of the *output* $h$, not of the pre-activation $z$; the buggy line uses $z$ in place of $h$, giving $1 - z^2$ wherever $z \ne h$, i.e. everywhere `tanh` actually bends the input. Both arrays have shape `(B, hidden_k)`, so nothing raises: `dZ1` is silently wrong, corrupting `dW1` and `dX`, while $Y$ and $\bar W_2$ stay exact since neither depends on this line. With `relu` in place of `tanh` this particular slip would be invisible — `z > 0` and `h > 0` are the same mask — and the error that bites there instead is writing the derivative as the activation itself, `np.where(z > 0, z, 0)`, which scales the gradient by $z$ rather than masking it.

```py
dZ1_shards = [dHk * (1 - Hk ** 2) for dHk, Hk in zip(dH_shards, H_shards)]   # tanh'(z) = 1 - h^2, h = tanh(z)
```

**The input gradient is never summed.** Every device multiplies the same $X$, so $X$ reaches the loss through all $n$ local products and its gradient is a sum over them, $\bar X = \sum_k \bar Z_{1,k} W_{1,k}^\top$: whatever the forward pass replicates or gathers, the backward pass has to sum back up. Returning the list of local products leaves device $k$ with a single one of those $n$ terms; every array keeps its shape `(B, d_in)`, so nothing raises, and $Y$, $\bar W_1$ and $\bar W_2$, none of which read $\bar X$, stay exact.

```py
dX_partial = [dZ1k @ W1k.T for dZ1k, W1k in zip(dZ1_shards, W1_shards)]
dX_shards = all_reduce(dX_partial)      # X is replicated, so its gradient is summed across devices
```

### Follow-ups

- With layer 1 column-parallel and layer 2 row-parallel, layer 1's output is already sharded along `d_hidden`, and an elementwise activation preserves that sharding exactly as layer 2 expects it — no communication happens between the two layers.
- One `all_reduce` in the forward pass (layer 2's sum) and one in the backward pass (layer 1's `dX` sum); everything else in this MLP is local.
- A bias is sharded like the weight it follows: column-parallel splits $b$ the same way as $W$'s columns and adds it locally; row-parallel adds the (unsplit) bias once after the forward `all_reduce`, or adds $b / n$ on every device before it, to avoid counting it $n$ times.
- In a ring implementation every device sends about $2(n-1)/n$ times the array size for an all-reduce and $(n-1)/n$ times for an all-gather: more devices shrink each device's computation, but hardly its traffic.
- A non-elementwise activation (softmax over `d_hidden`, say) would need the full pre-activation row on every device, turning the free lunch between the two layers into an extra `all_gather`.
