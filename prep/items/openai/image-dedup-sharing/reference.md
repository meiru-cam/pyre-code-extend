Worth confirming first: whether a deleted `image_id` may ever be reused, and whether the object store can issue short-lived signed URLs, which both the upload and the download path rely on. Assumed here: ids are never reused, signed URLs are available, and anything over 100 MiB is rejected outright.

### Requirements and scale

**Storage.** $U = 400{,}000$ uploads/day at an average size $s = 3$ MiB give $U \cdot s = 1{,}200{,}000$ MiB $\approx 1.14$ TiB/day arriving at the service, before dedup. At a $30\%$ duplicate rate, $(1 - 0.30) \cdot 1{,}200{,}000 = 840{,}000$ MiB $\approx 820.3$ GiB/day is genuinely new content needing a new object — the store's daily growth, $840{,}000 \times 365 \approx 292.4$ TiB/year at a steady duplicate rate. Deletions claw some of this back over time, but sizing for a year of pure growth is the conservative number to provision against.

**Upload path.** Average QPS is $400{,}000 / 86{,}400 \approx 4.6$; a $5\times$ peak-to-average ratio (uploads cluster in evenings and weekends, smoothed by 40 million users across time zones) gives about $23$ QPS at peak — provision for roughly $25$ QPS.

**Download path and bandwidth.** $4{,}000{,}000$ downloads/day is a $10\!:\!1$ read-to-write ratio, about $46.3$ QPS on average against the metadata layer, which every view and download has to reach regardless of whether the bytes come from cache (deep dive (c)). At the assumed 3 MiB average size that is $4{,}000{,}000 \times 3 \approx 11.44$ TiB/day of image bytes served; with a $92\%$ CDN hit rate only the remaining $8\%$ — about $0.92$ TiB/day, $\approx 93$ Mbps sustained and $\approx 373$ Mbps at a $4\times$ read peak — has to come out of the object store.

### Data model and API

**Blob** — `sha256` (primary key, the 64 hex-character content hash), `generation`, `size_bytes`, `state` (`pending | committed | deleting | deleted`), `ref_count`, `created_at`, `state_since` (when `state` last changed; for a `pending` row, when an upload last claimed it). Its object key is derived, not stored: `blobs/{sha256[0:2]}/{sha256[2:4]}/{sha256}/{generation}`. The hash prefix spreads objects across the store's key space instead of collecting them under one prefix; the generation means that once a generation is tombstoned, its key is never written again (deep dive (b)).

**Image** — `image_id` (primary key, 128 random bits: holding the id is what grants view access, so it must be neither guessable nor enumerable, as a sequential id would be), `owner_id`, `sha256` (references `Blob`), `filename`, `content_type`, `uploaded_at`. A composite index on `(owner_id, uploaded_at)` serves a user's own upload list; an index on `sha256` backs deep dive (b)'s reconciliation job.

**Upload** — `upload_id`, `owner_id`, `multipart_upload_id` (empty for a single PUT), `image_id` (written by the transaction that creates the image, and only while still empty), `created_at`. **GcQueue** — the `(sha256, generation)` of an object waiting to be deleted, and `enqueued_at`.

Core APIs:

- `POST /uploads` — `{size_bytes, content_type}` → writes an `Upload` row and returns `{upload_id, upload_url}` for sizes under 8 MiB, or `{upload_id, multipart_upload_id, part_size, part_urls}` at or above it. Either way the bytes land at a temporary key `staging/{upload_id}`, not the final content-addressed one, which isn't known yet.
- `POST /uploads/{upload_id}/complete` — `{filename, content_type}` (plus the part list for a multipart upload) → `{image_id, sha256, status: "active"}`. A retry after it already succeeded finds `Upload.image_id` set and replays that result instead of creating a second image.
- `GET /images/{image_id}` — `{filename, size_bytes, uploaded_at}`; 404 if the id was never issued or has since been deleted.
- `GET /images/{image_id}/download` — a short-lived signed URL (or CDN redirect) for the content; same 404 rule as above.
- `DELETE /images/{image_id}` — owner-only; `{status: "deleted"}`.

```

An upload calls the Upload API for a URL, then PUTs (or multipart-PUTs) its bytes straight to `staging`. On `complete`, the Upload API reads the staged bytes once, hashing them and spooling them to local disk, and claims the content in the metadata DB: content already stored is linked right away; otherwise a create-if-absent write puts the spooled bytes under the content's key in `blobs`, and a second transaction commits the `Image` row (deep dive (a) walks through what each step leaves behind if the process dies partway). A view or download first asks the Read API, which checks the `image_id` against the metadata DB, then hands back a URL resolving through the CDN edge to the object in `blobs` — most requests are satisfied at the edge and never reach `blobs` at all. The sweep task runs independently of any request: it tombstones rows that have sat in `deleting` or `pending` for an hour, deletes the queued objects from `blobs`, and clears the staging objects of uploads more than a day old.

### Deep dives

**(a) The upload path's multi-step commit.** Two designs for how a client with matching content could avoid re-sending it: let it declare a hash up front and skip the upload if the store already has it, or always require the full bytes and hash them server-side. The first is a real vulnerability: a hash is not a secret — in this design it appears in every download URL — so anyone who has seen another user's content hash, but never the bytes, would get a live `image_id` and a signed download URL for content they never possessed. This design takes the second option: the server links a user to a blob only after it has hashed the bytes itself, in step 1 of `complete`.

`complete` runs, in order: (1) read `staging/{upload_id}` once, computing its SHA-256 while spooling the bytes to local disk and rejecting anything over 100 MiB; every later step uses this copy, because the client's signed PUT URL may still be valid and a second read could return bytes it replaced after the hash; (2) a *claim* transaction on the `Blob` row: `committed` or `deleting` → link now (increment `ref_count`, set `committed`, insert `Image`, set `Upload.image_id`) and skip to step 5; absent → insert it as `pending` with generation 1; `deleted` at generation $g$ → `pending` at $g + 1$; `pending` → keep its generation and refresh `state_since`; (3) a create-if-absent write of the spooled bytes to that generation's key — multipart at 8 MiB and above, readable only once completed; winning the write and finding the object already there both mean a complete object is in place, since a single-key write is atomic; (4) a *commit* transaction: `UPDATE blob SET state = 'committed', ref_count = ref_count + 1 WHERE sha256 = ? AND generation = ? AND state <> 'deleted'`, insert `Image`, set `Upload.image_id`; zero rows updated means the generation was reclaimed meanwhile, so go back to step 2; (5) delete the staging object.

A crash before step 2 leaves only a staging object: the sweep takes every `Upload` row older than 24 hours, deletes its staging object (aborting a multipart session that is still open) and then the row. A crash between steps 2 and 4 leaves a `pending` row and perhaps a complete object; a retry of `complete`, or any other upload of the same content, picks up the same generation and finishes it, and if none comes the sweep reclaims the row once it has been `pending` for an hour. A crash inside a transaction rolls it back, and a crash after step 4 leaves only the staging object.

Two users uploading identical content at the same time serialize on the `Blob` row in step 2 — the first inserts `pending`, the second finds it and takes the same generation — and then race on step 3's create-if-absent write: exactly one call creates the object, and the other finds it already complete. Both commits succeed, each with its own `Image` row, whichever call won the write.

**(b) Deletion and reference counting.** `ref_count` on `Blob` could either be a denormalized counter, updated in the same transaction as every `Image` insert or delete, or derived on demand from `COUNT(*) FROM image WHERE sha256 = ?`. The counter is what this design uses, since deciding whether a delete just removed the last reference has to be cheap and on the hot path, and a transactional `UPDATE blob SET ref_count = ref_count ± 1 ...` gives that for free: two transactions touching the same `Blob` row take a row lock, so concurrent increments and decrements on one blob always serialize instead of racing on a separate read-then-write. The cost is that the counter is only as trustworthy as every write path that touches it — a manual data fix or a bulk migration on `Image` rows directly would leave it wrong with no way to notice — so a nightly job recomputes `COUNT(*)` per `sha256` and corrects any `Blob.ref_count` that has drifted.

`DELETE /images/{image_id}` is one metadata transaction: delete the `Image` row whose `owner_id` matches and, only if a row was actually deleted — so a retried DELETE changes nothing — decrement `ref_count`, setting `state = 'deleting'` and stamping `state_since` when it reaches zero. Deletion never touches the object store. The sweep later picks rows that have sat in `deleting` for an hour (the grace period), or in `pending` for an hour since their last claim. For each it runs one transaction — a conditional update `... WHERE state = <state it read> AND generation = <generation it read>` that tombstones the row to the terminal `deleted`, plus an insert of that `(sha256, generation)` into `GcQueue` — and only afterwards deletes each queued object and then its queue row. A crash anywhere leaves queue rows that the next run processes again; deleting an object twice is harmless.

The interesting race is a new upload of that exact content landing close to when its last reference was deleted. The claim, the commit, the delete and the tombstone all update the same `Blob` row, so the store serializes them. If the upload comes first, `ref_count` never reaches zero. If the row is already `deleting`, the claim *revives* it in place — back to `committed`, `ref_count` from zero to one, same generation — which is safe because an object is only ever deleted after its generation is tombstoned. If the row is already `deleted`, its object is gone or about to be: the sweep's delete is unconditional and may still be in flight, so rewriting the same key would not help — a create-if-absent write could find the doomed object and write nothing, or the late delete could land after the rewrite. That is why the claim moves the row to `pending` under generation $g + 1$ and writes a new key: a late delete can only hit a generation that no row points to any more. Each content therefore has at most one live object at a time; an object of a dead generation lingers only until its queue row is processed.

The conditional updates, not the grace period, keep references valid. The grace period saves a rewrite when content is re-uploaded soon after its last delete; and since one `complete` takes seconds, as long as none runs past an hour, no write to a generation is still in flight when it is tombstoned — otherwise a write landing after its generation was purged would leave an object that nothing points to.

**(c) The read path at scale.** Two ways to key the CDN's cache: by `image_id`, or by the content key (`sha256` plus generation) that `image_id` resolves to. Content-keyed caching is the better fit here precisely because of deduplication: the same bytes are typically fetched under many different `image_id`s — any image sharing that content — so one content-keyed entry serves all of them, while an id-keyed cache would need a separate, redundant copy per id for content that is, by construction, identical. Since the bytes under a content key never change — only whether the key exists changes — a content-keyed entry can also carry a long, effectively "immutable" TTL, with nothing to invalidate on a write.

The cost of keying by content is that the cache key alone says nothing about who is allowed to see it, so the access decision cannot be made at the edge: every view or download still reaches the Read API first, which checks that `image_id` currently resolves to a live `Image` row before handing back a URL — a signed, short-lived one (5 minutes here) scoped to the content key. The edge verifies that signature on every request, hit or miss, and leaves it out of the cache key, so differently signed URLs for the same content share one cached copy; without the check at the edge, a cache hit would serve anyone who knew the content key. Deleting an `image_id` revokes exactly this: the moment `DELETE /images/{image_id}` commits, that id starts 404ing at the Read API's check on every subsequent request — but it does not, and structurally cannot, touch the CDN's cache entry for the content, since other `image_id`s may still resolve to the same bytes. The bound on how long a just-deleted image's bytes stay fetchable is therefore the signed URL's own TTL, not the CDN's: a URL handed out moments before the delete keeps working for up to 5 more minutes, and once the content's last reference is gone and its last URL has expired, the cached copy is unreachable and simply ages out.

### Follow-ups

- A proof-of-possession challenge — the server names a random byte range of the stored content and the client must return that range's hash — would let a genuine duplicate skip the upload while still refusing a caller who knows only the hash, saving at most the 30% duplicate share, about 352 GiB of upload a day. It stays out by default because the skip itself tells the client that someone already stored this exact content, an existence check on other users' images.
- Near-duplicate detection (visually similar but not byte-identical images) is a separate system — a perceptual hash plus a nearest-neighbor index — layered alongside this exact-content path, not built into it.
- Content that must stop being served at once, such as after a legal request, cannot wait for 5-minute URLs to lapse: delete every `Image` row with that `sha256`, tombstone its `Blob` without waiting for the grace period, and purge its content key from the CDN.
