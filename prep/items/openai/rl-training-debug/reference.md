Start by running the script and reading its four printed columns as four instruments: `reward` says whether the agent is getting better, `entropy` whether the policy still explores, `value loss` and `mean adv` whether the baseline is any good. The value of the loss is not one of the instruments: it is a surrogate whose scale moves with the advantages, and watching it fall is no evidence that the policy is improving. Each bug hides the next one, and each is pinned down by a different failing test.

### The four bugs

- Bugs fixed so far: none · Output of `python gridworld_pg.py`: `reward` is `-0.400` at every printed iteration; `test 1: every environment ran the same trajectory` · Points to: bug 1, how the action is picked
- Bugs fixed so far: 1 · Output of `python gridworld_pg.py`: `reward` never gets above the -0.272 of the first iteration and is pinned at -0.400 over the last 50; `test 2: log pi of a rewarded action went -1.671 -> -15.674` · Points to: bug 2, the sign of the advantage
- Bugs fixed so far: 1, 2 · Output of `python gridworld_pg.py`: `reward` stays between -0.400 and -0.209 for all 120 iterations; `test 3: reward-to-go is [-0.02, -0.0394, 1.0, 0.95]` · Points to: bug 3, the direction of the loop
- Bugs fixed so far: 1, 2, 3 · Output of `python gridworld_pg.py`: `reward` climbs to +1.576; `test 4: the baseline is off by -0.545 on average` · Points to: bug 4, the missing `detach()`
- Bugs fixed so far: all · Output of `python gridworld_pg.py`: `reward` +1.640, `value loss` 0.077, `mean adv` +0.010; `all tests passed`

The four bugs sit at four joints of the loop: how the data is collected (`rollout`), how each step in it is scored (`compute_returns`), how a score turns into a gradient (the sign in `surrogate`), and which paths that gradient takes back into the parameters (the `detach` in `surrogate`). Each joint can be checked on its own, without training anything.

**Bug 1: `action = logits.argmax(dim=-1)` in `rollout`.** The policy gradient is $\nabla_\theta J = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi(a \mid s) \, A(s, a)]$, and the one-sample form used here estimates it only when the action really was drawn from $\pi$. `argmax` makes the behaviour deterministic, so all 64 copies — same start square, same transition rule — run the very same trajectory, and the 1280 steps of a rollout carry one trajectory's worth of information. Over the 120 iterations the reward takes exactly two values, -0.400 on 119 of them and +1.640 once: either that single path happens to cross the goal or no copy reaches it at all. Nothing ever tries a different move, and $\nabla \log \pi(\arg\max)$ only sharpens the preference the network already has. Greedy selection is the right thing when the policy is being evaluated, which is where such a line usually comes from; the rollout that feeds the gradient has to sample.

```py
action = Categorical(logits=logits).sample()        # was logits.argmax(dim=-1)
```

**Bug 2: `advantages = values - returns` in `surrogate`.** The advantage is the return minus the baseline. Swapped, `policy_loss` becomes $+\overline{\log \pi \cdot (G - V)}$, and descending it descends the expected return: every step that did better than predicted is made *less* likely. Test 2 takes one SGD step on eight copies of a step whose return, 5.0, is far above anything the untrained baseline predicts, and the log-probability of the action taken drops from -1.671 to -15.674. In training the agent learns to stay away from square 24: the reward never gets above the -0.272 of the first iteration and settles on -0.400, the floor of this environment, 20 steps at -0.02 with the reward never collected. `value_loss` squares the same difference, so it never complains.

```py
advantages = returns - values                       # was values - returns
```

**Bug 3: `for t in range(rewards.shape[0])` in `compute_returns`.** Reward-to-go obeys $G_t = r_t + \gamma G_{t+1}$ inside an episode, so the recursion has to be unrolled from the last step backwards; the `dones` factor is what stops it from reaching across the end of an episode. Run forwards it computes $G_t = r_t + \gamma r_{t-1} + \gamma^2 r_{t-2} + \cdots$ instead, a discounted sum of the rewards collected *before* step $t$. On the four-step stretch of test 3, rewards $(-0.02, -0.02, 1, -0.02)$ with the third step terminal, the correct answer is `[0.9015, 0.95, 1.0, -0.02]` and the loop gives `[-0.02, -0.0394, 1.0, 0.95]`: the goal reward goes to the step *after* the goal and withheld from the steps that led to it. A step cannot have caused what happened before it, so these scores carry no signal about the action, and the reward stays between -0.400 and -0.209 for all 120 iterations.

```py
for t in reversed(range(rewards.shape[0])):         # was range(rewards.shape[0])
```

**Bug 4: `advantages` is not detached inside `policy_loss`.** In $\nabla \log \pi \cdot A$ the advantage is a coefficient — a number saying how hard to push — not something to differentiate through. Left attached it opens a second path from `policy_loss` into `value`, and the two terms settle where they cancel. Per step, up to the $1/N$ that both means contribute, the derivative of the loss with respect to $V$ is $\log \pi(a \mid s) + 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot (V - G)$, which vanishes at

$$
G - V = \log \pi(a \mid s),
$$

so the baseline comes to rest one surprisal above the return it is meant to predict, and averaged over a rollout the advantage equals minus the entropy: -0.586 against an entropy of 0.612 at iteration 119, with `value loss` at 0.528 instead of 0.077. Training still works, because $-H(s)$ depends on the state and not on the action, and shifting a baseline by a function of the state leaves the policy gradient unbiased — it only adds variance, and this run does reach the optimal +1.640. What it destroys is the value estimate itself, which is the thing a bootstrapped target or a KL penalty would be built on. The check that settles it needs no training: `torch.autograd.grad(policy_loss, model.value.weight, allow_unused=True)[0]` has to be `None`, and anything else means the policy term is training the baseline.

```py
policy_loss = -(dist.log_prob(actions) * advantages.detach()).mean()    # was advantages
```

### Follow-ups

- Reusing one rollout for several gradient steps breaks the estimator, because from the second step on the log-probabilities come from a policy that did not collect the data. PPO and GRPO repair it with the importance ratio $\pi_\theta(a \mid s) / \pi_{\mathrm{old}}(a \mid s)$ and clip it to $[1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon]$, so that once an update has pushed an action past the clip in the direction its advantage favours, that action contributes no further gradient.
- A KL penalty against a reference policy bounds the drift of the whole distribution, which the clipped ratio does not: clipping only limits the actions that appear in the batch. In RLHF the reference is the policy before the RL stage, and the penalty is what keeps the model from collapsing onto whatever the reward model scores highest.
- The advantage rather than the raw return, because $\mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi}[\nabla \log \pi(a \mid s) \, b(s)] = 0$ for any $b$ that does not depend on the action: subtracting a baseline changes no expectation, only the variance. With returns alone every action taken in a good state is reinforced, the bad ones included.
- GRPO removes the value network: it samples a group of $K$ answers to the same prompt and uses the group's own mean return as the baseline. There is then no learned estimate for bug 4 to corrupt, at the price of $K$ rollouts per prompt and of a baseline that only compares answers to one another.
- A rollout stops after 20 steps whether or not the episode is over, and `compute_returns` treats that cut like the end of an episode, so the last steps lose whatever came after it. The usual repair is to add $\gamma V(s)$ for the square a copy stopped in unless it had just terminated, which means keeping "the episode ended" and "the rollout ran out of steps" apart in the mask.
