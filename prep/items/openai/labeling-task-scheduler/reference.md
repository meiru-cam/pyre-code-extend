Two points worth confirming before coding: whether the balance conditions must hold at every prefix or only at the end (the stronger per-prefix version below is what makes Part 2 non-trivial, and what every construction here targets), and whether repeated labeling is forbidden per (task, human) pair, as assumed below, or per full (task, model, human) triple, which would let a human see the same task again under a different model.

### Part 1

Uniqueness forbids two assignments with the same (task, human) pair, so a single human can appear in at most $t$ assignments, one per task. Coverage then forces $k \le t$; this bound is also sufficient. Given valid dimensions ($t, m, h > 0$), `build_basic_schedule` returns `[]` when $k = 0$ and `None` when $k > t$; with an invalid dimension ($t \le 0$, $m \le 0$, or $h \le 0$) it returns `None` regardless of $k$.

Every assignment raises exactly one human's total by 1, so meeting coverage for all $h$ humans needs at least $h \cdot k$ assignments; a schedule that gives every human exactly $k$, no more, is therefore minimal. Round $r = 0, \dots, k-1$ gives human $u$ the task $(u + r) \bmod t$: since $r$ ranges over $k \le t$ consecutive residues, the $k$ tasks assigned to one human are pairwise distinct, so uniqueness holds, and every human ends up with exactly $k$ tasks over the $k$ rounds.

```python
def build_basic_schedule(t, m, h, k):
    if t <= 0 or m <= 0 or h <= 0:
        return None
    if k == 0:
        return []
    if k > t:
        return None
    schedule = []
    for r in range(k):
        for u in range(h):
            schedule.append(((u + r) % t, 0, u))   # NOTE: model is unconstrained in Part 1; 0 is simplest
    return schedule
```

### Part 2

Fix a task $x$ and look only at its own occurrences, in schedule order — this is what the `task_seen[x]` counter below tracks. Giving its $c$-th occurrence ($c = 0, 1, 2, \dots$) the model $c \bmod m$ is a round-robin: writing $c = qm + s$ with $0 \le s < m$, models $0, \dots, s-1$ have each been used $q + 1$ times and models $s, \dots, m-1$ have each been used $q$ times, so the counts differ by at most 1 — for every $c$, i.e. at every prefix, not only when $c$ is a multiple of $m$.

```python
def build_balanced_schedule(t, m, h, k):
    if t <= 0 or m <= 0 or h <= 0:
        return None
    if k == 0:
        return []
    if k > t:
        return None
    task_seen = [0] * t
    schedule = []
    for r in range(k):
        for u in range(h):
            task = (u + r) % t
            model = task_seen[task] % m          # NOTE: task_seen[task] is x's occurrence count so far
            task_seen[task] += 1
            schedule.append((task, model, u))
    return schedule
```

### Part 3

**Lemma.** If a sequence of increments always adds 1 to whichever of $m$ counters, all starting at 0, currently has the smallest value (ties broken any way), then after every prefix of the sequence the counters differ by at most 1.

*Proof.* By induction on the number of increments. Initially every counter is 0. Suppose that before some increment, every counter's value is either $L$ or $L + 1$, where $L$ is the current minimum (the base case has $L = 0$). The counter chosen for the increment has value $L$, since it is a minimum; after the increment it becomes $L + 1$, and every other counter is unchanged, so its value is still $L$ or $L + 1$. Hence every counter's value is $L$ or $L + 1$ afterward too, and the difference stays at most 1.

Keep Part 2's round order — task $(u + r) \bmod t$ for human $u$ in round $r$ — but choose the model with the lemma: for the assignment on task $x$ by human $u$, pick the model minimizing $x$'s own current count, breaking ties by $u$'s own current count and then by model index. Applying the lemma to each task's counters, which change only when that task is scheduled and always by incrementing one of their own minimums, shows balance by task holds at every prefix — for any tie-break rule, unlike Part 2's one specific cyclic order.

```python
def build_doubly_balanced_schedule(t, m, h, k):
    if t <= 0 or m <= 0 or h <= 0:
        return None
    if k == 0:
        return []
    if k > t:
        return None
    task_count = [[0] * m for _ in range(t)]
    human_count = [[0] * m for _ in range(h)]
    schedule = []
    for r in range(k):
        for u in range(h):
            task = (u + r) % t
            # NOTE: argmin over the task's own counts first; the human's counts only break ties,
            # so they can lose every tie and the human axis stays unprotected (see the text above).
            model = min(range(m), key=lambda i: (task_count[task][i], human_count[u][i], i))
            task_count[task][model] += 1
            human_count[u][model] += 1
            schedule.append((task, model, u))
    return schedule
```

Balance by human is not guaranteed, and not only because of a bad tie-break. With $t = 2$, $m = 3$, $h = 6$, $k = 2$, human 4's two assignments both land on model 2. The first is on task 0, whose counts are $(1, 1, 0)$ at that point, so the argmin is uniquely model 2; the second, a round later, is on task 1, whose counts are then $(2, 2, 1)$, so the argmin is again uniquely model 2. Neither step has a tie to break, so no tie-break rule could have sent human 4 to a different model either time; its final counts are $(0, 0, 2)$, a difference of 2. The failure belongs to this greedy rule, not to the task: for the same parameters a schedule that is balanced by task and by human does exist (it is checked in the code below).

### Follow-ups

- Swapping the priority (a human's own counts first, a task's counts second) is symmetric: it certifies balance by human instead, at the cost of the same kind of failure on the task axis.
- If tasks stream in day by day instead of arriving all at once, keep `task_count`, `human_count` and each human's running total across days instead of rebuilding them, and cap every human to one assignment per day as an extra rule layered on the same balance requirements.
- Parts 1 and 2 run in $O(h k)$ time; Part 3's per-step argmin over $m$ models makes it $O(h k m)$, or $O(h k \log m)$ with a per-task and per-human min-heap.
