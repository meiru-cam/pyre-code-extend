Worth confirming before designing: whether casual games get the same move-relay and clock guarantees as rated ones (assumed yes below — only the rating update is skipped), and whether time controls are a small fixed catalog (bullet/blitz/rapid) rather than a value typed in freely (assumed fixed, since a matchmaking pool has to be finite to search).

### Requirements and scale

**Peak concurrency.** 300,000 online players means 150,000 concurrent games. At 80 moves over an 8-minute (480 s) game, the average gap between moves in a given game is $480/80 = 6\text{ s}$, so peak move rate across all games is $150{,}000/6 = 25{,}000$ moves/s. Each accepted move goes to two sockets (an ack to the mover, an update to the opponent), so peak WebSocket traffic for moves is $50{,}000$ messages/s; at roughly 150 bytes each that is only $\approx 7.5$ MB/s aggregate — bandwidth is not the bottleneck; connection count and per-move CPU are.

**Connection-serving fleet.** Every online player — mid-game, queued, or idle — holds one persistent WebSocket connection. Budgeting 20,000 connections per gateway instance (bounded by per-connection buffers and fan-out cost, not raw memory) needs $\lceil 300{,}000/20{,}000\rceil = 15$ instances at bare peak; 17 with two extra for rolling deploys and failover.

**Game-service fleet.** Each game must live in one process's memory so move validation and clock math for that game never race across machines. Budgeting 5,000 games per instance (bounded by per-game CPU and one open timeout timer per game) needs $\lceil 150{,}000/5{,}000\rceil = 30$ instances bare, 32 with the same margin.

**Move-history storage.** A persisted move entry (ply, the move, both players' remaining time after it, the server's receive timestamp, the idempotency key) is about 80 bytes; the board position (FEN) is kept once on the game's row, not per move, so a game's move log is about $80 \times 80\text{ B} = 6.4$ KB. Games in progress average about a third of the peak figure across a day (a 3x peak-to-average ratio is reasonable for a global player base), so by Little's law (arrival rate = number in the system / time in the system) new games start at $50{,}000 / 480\text{ s} \approx 104$/s, about 9,000,000 finished games/day — daily growth of $9\times10^6 \times 6.4\text{ KB} \approx 57.6$ GB, about 21 TB/year before replication. The history store takes one write per finished game, so one well-sharded relational cluster is enough.

### Data model and API

**Player** — `player_id`, `username`, `rating_bullet`, `rating_blitz`, `rating_rapid` (one rating per time-control category), `created_at`.

**QueueEntry** — `entry_id`, `player_id`, `mode` (`rated`/`casual`), `time_control` (`{base_s, increment_s}`), `rating_snapshot`, `joined_at`, `status` (`waiting`/`matched`/`cancelled`/`expired`), `matched_game_id`.

**Game** — `game_id`, `white_player_id`, `black_player_id`, `mode`, `time_control`, `status`, `result` (`white`/`black`/`draw`, null while active), `result_reason` (`checkmate`/`stalemate`/`resignation`/`timeout`/`draw_agreement`/`threefold_repetition`/`fifty_move`/`abandonment`), `current_fen` (the position as a one-line FEN string, kept as a read cache), `repetition_counts` (how many times each position key — placement, side to move, castling rights, en passant square — has occurred since the last capture or pawn move, which clear it; the fifty-move count is the FEN's own halfmove clock), `ply` (next move number expected), `turn`, `white_remaining_ms`, `black_remaining_ms`, `turn_started_at_ms` (server time the side to move's turn began), `version` (bumped on every accepted move, resignation, draw, or timeout), `owner_epoch` (fencing token, bumped each time the game is reassigned to a new owner), `started_at`, `ended_at`.

**MoveRecord** (append-only) — `game_id`, `ply`, `player_id`, `uci` (e.g. `g1f3`), `client_move_id` (client-generated idempotency key), `white_remaining_ms_after`, `black_remaining_ms_after`, `server_received_at_ms`, `version_after`.

REST, for anything that is not latency-critical:

- `POST /v1/matchmaking/queue` — `{mode, time_control}` → `{entry_id, status}`.
- `DELETE /v1/matchmaking/queue/{entry_id}` — leave the queue.
- `GET /v1/games/{game_id}` — current snapshot (`current_fen`, clocks, `version`, `status`), for a client before its WebSocket connects, or for post-game review.
- `GET /v1/games/{game_id}/moves` — the full move history.

WebSocket, for everything inside an active game:

- Client → server: `move {game_id, ply, uci, client_move_id}`, `resign {game_id}`, `draw_offer {game_id}`, `draw_response {game_id, accept}`, `reconnect {game_id, last_seen_version}`.
- Server → client: `queue.matched {game_id, color, opponent, time_control}`, `move.applied {game_id, version, ply, uci, current_fen, turn, white_remaining_ms, black_remaining_ms, server_now_ms}`, `move.rejected {game_id, expected_ply, reason}`, `clock.sync {game_id, version, white_remaining_ms, black_remaining_ms, server_now_ms}` (right after a reconnect), `moves.backfill {game_id, moves, from_version, to_version}` (on reconnect, to replay anything missed), `game.ended {game_id, result, result_reason, final_version}`.

Walk-through of one move: the client sends `move` to its gateway, which looks up the game's owner in its cached copy of the routing table and forwards the message without checking any chess rules. The owner stamps the move with its own receive time as it enters the game's event queue. When the move reaches the head of that queue, the owner first recognizes a retry by its `client_move_id`, then checks the turn and `ply`, and validates legality with an existing chess-rules library (en passant, castling and repetition are where hand-written validators go wrong). It then computes the new clock reading and looks for an ending the move itself produces — no legal reply for the opponent, checkmate if that side is in check and stalemate if it is not; a third occurrence of the new position in `repetition_counts`; a halfmove clock that has reached 100 — writes the new game state together with the appended `MoveRecord` to the live-state store in one fenced write, re-arms the timeout timer for the new side to move, and pushes `move.applied` through the gateways to both sockets; a rejected move gets `move.rejected` back to the sender only.

### Deep dives

**The server-authoritative clock.** Two designs: tick every second, decrementing the running clock and writing or broadcasting each tick; or recompute the clock only on the two events that can change it — a move being accepted, or nobody moving until time runs out. Ticking means 150,000 writes/s (every concurrent game, once a second), six times the move rate, for a value nobody reads between events, so the design below is event-based.

On a move stamped $t_{\text{recv}}$, with $r$ the mover's remaining time and $t_{\text{turn}}$ (`turn_started_at_ms`) the start of the turn, the mover's new remaining time is

$$r' = r - (t_{\text{recv}} - t_{\text{turn}}) + \text{inc}, \quad \text{only if } r - (t_{\text{recv}} - t_{\text{turn}}) > 0$$

so the increment is added after a completed move (a Fischer increment). If the difference is not positive, the move is rejected and the mover loses on time — a move that arrives after the flag fell cannot save the game. Then $t_{\text{turn}} := t_{\text{recv}}$, `turn` switches, `version` increments, and the client's on-screen timer just counts down from the readings in the latest `move.applied` or `clock.sync`. No clock runs before a side's first move; instead that move has a fixed deadline (say 20 s), and missing it aborts the game with no result.

Timeout with no move: after every accepted move the owner arms one in-process timer for the new side to move at its deadline $t_{\text{turn}} + r$, cancelling the previous one. A game's moves and timer firings go through one per-game event queue processed one event at a time, and $t_{\text{recv}}$ is taken when a move enters that queue. A firing carries the `version` captured when it was armed and declares the timeout only if `version` is unchanged: cancelling fails when the firing is already queued behind a move, and the check turns that stale firing into a no-op. A firing enters the queue no earlier than the deadline, so a move stamped before the deadline is always processed first; the outcome depends only on the move's stamp versus the deadline, not on which event happens to run first. Stamping at the gateway would break this, since a move stamped in time could still reach the queue after the firing.

Latency compensation (optional): the charged time includes one round trip of the mover's connection (the opponent's move going out, the reply coming back). Crediting back the round-trip time the server itself measures on that socket, at most e.g. 100 ms per move and never more than the time charged, removes most of this bias; the cap also bounds what a client gains by delaying its pong replies to inflate the measurement. Without it, a player on a 100 ms connection loses about 4 s over 40 moves, a lot in a one-minute game and little at 5+3, so turn it on for bullet only.

**Move consistency and routing within a game.** Where a game's state lives comes first. A stateless fleet — any instance serves any move, reading the game's row from a store sharded by `game_id`, validating, writing it back under a conditional update — owns nothing, so it needs neither lease nor fencing token, and 25,000 moves/s over 30 shards is under 900 moves/s each. It loses on the clock: the 50 ms target wants one in-process timer per game, which a stateless fleet has to replace with a scheduler sweeping 150,000 deadlines on a period shorter than 50 ms, and a move has to be ordered against its own timeout firing by its receive stamp, which a per-game event queue settles in memory and two independent writers settle only by re-reading after a lost conditional update. So games are owned here, and owning them costs leases, fencing tokens, and a gap at takeover.

Two ways to route a game's messages to the process owning its state: pure consistent hashing on `game_id`, every gateway computing the owner from a shared ring; or an explicit routing table (`game_id` → current owner) that gateways look up and cache. Both are used, for different jobs: the ring (with virtual nodes) only computes placement — where a new game goes, and where a dead instance's games go, spread over all survivors — and the table records the result. A game changes owner only when its owner dies, so resizing the fleet moves no game in progress; with the ring alone, every membership change would remap games mid-play, and gateways that saw the change at different moments would send one game's moves to two instances.

Neither structure rules out two owners by itself: a gateway's cached entry can be stale, and an instance declared dead may only have paused (a long GC pause, a network partition) and then resume. So ownership is a lease: each instance renews one lease covering all its games every second, with a 5 s time-to-live, and stops accepting moves as soon as a renewal fails; a controller reassigns an instance's games only after its lease has expired, bumping each game's `owner_epoch`. Every live-state write is conditional on the writer's `owner_epoch` and the expected `version`, so a stale owner's write fails and it drops the game, and a gateway told `not_owner` refreshes its entry and retries.

Exactly-once, in-order moves: a move whose `client_move_id` is already recorded is a retry and gets the recorded result back, so a client that lost only the acknowledgment sees the game continue, not an error. Any other move must come from the side to move with `ply` equal to the game's current `ply` — an optimistic-concurrency check that rejects a stale or out-of-turn move before it mutates anything. The order matters: checking `ply` first would reject the retry of a move that was in fact applied.

Recovery when an instance dies: a move is acknowledged only after its fenced write (the new game state plus the appended `MoveRecord`) is on a majority of the live-state store's replicas — a few milliseconds inside one region, small next to the two client legs of the 120 ms budget. With no majority reachable the move is rejected and the client retries; it is never acknowledged first and written afterwards. So no acknowledged move is lost, and a move written but not yet acknowledged when the owner crashed is found by its `client_move_id` when the client retries, so it is not applied twice. A live game's entry is never evicted. The new owner loads the game from live state and re-arms the timer of the side to move. The failover gap, when no move could be accepted, is not charged: the side to move is charged only up to the old owner's last lease renewal (nothing if the turn began after it), and $t_{\text{turn}}$ restarts at the takeover. When the game ends, the owner writes the move list, the result and both new ratings to the history store in one transaction that first inserts the finished game's row and does nothing if that row already exists, so a retry after a crash never applies a rating change twice; only then is the live entry deleted.

Reconnect (the client's own network, or the gateway holding its socket dying and taking 20,000 sockets with it, which is why reconnects carry jitter): the client sends `reconnect {game_id, last_seen_version}` once its socket is back up; the gateway routes it through the table, which may now point elsewhere, and the owner records that gateway as the player's new delivery address. The owner replies with `moves.backfill` — every `MoveRecord` whose `version_after` exceeds `last_seen_version`, taken from the live game, since the history store only receives finished games — plus a `clock.sync` computed at the current server time; the client then resends its unacknowledged move, if any, with the original `client_move_id`.

**Matchmaking.** Each (time control, mode) pair has its own pool of waiting players. A pool can use fixed rating buckets, a search scanning every bucket that overlaps the ±Δ window and filtering (searching only the player's own bucket would make a player next to a boundary miss an opponent one point away); or one structure sorted by rating, where one range query returns the closest rating within Δ, with no bucket width to tune and nothing to filter. The latter is buckets at one-point granularity, and is used here.

Widening rule: $\Delta(w) = \min(\Delta_0 + \text{rate} \times w, \Delta_{\max})$, with $w$ the time waited — e.g. ±40 points at join, +20 points per second, reaching the ±400 cap after 18 s. Too strict leaves players in a thin pool (an off-peak time control, an extreme rating) waiting indefinitely; too loose gives lopsided pairings to players who would have found a close match a moment later; a window that grows keeps both from happening.

Pairing and sharding: each pool is owned by one single-threaded matcher that, every 100 ms, walks its entries oldest first, pairs each with the closest-rated entry inside that entry's window, removes both, and asks the game service to create the game; with one thread per pool, a player can never be handed to two games, and no lock is needed. The load is small: at peak $150{,}000/480 \approx 312$ games start per second, so about 625 players join per second, and with a mean wait of at most 2 s (the p95 target is 4 s) Little's law puts only $625 \times 2 = 1{,}250$ entries in all the pools at once — far below one core, so the service is split by pool for failure isolation, not throughput: each pool lives whole on one shard, so range queries never cross shards, and a standby rebuilds a failed shard's pools from the `waiting` queue entries.

### Follow-ups

- Spectating needs a separate broadcast path (one game, unboundedly many watchers) rather than the 1:1 relay above, which is sized and ordered for exactly two recipients.
- A daily (multi-day) time control should not keep a game resident in memory for days: load it per move, and put its deadline in the durable table a scheduler polls.
