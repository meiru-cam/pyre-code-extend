Worth confirming first: whether the client always supplies a radius, or sometimes only a desired count $K$ with no radius; and whether an approximate $K$-nearest result is acceptable or the answer must be exact. The design below treats a radius as optional (a $K$-nearest query picks its own starting radius) and treats exactness as a hard requirement.

### Requirements and scale

**POI record size.** Each POI stores `poi_id`, `owner_id`, `lat`, `lon` (four 8-byte fields), a `name` (~24 bytes), an `address` (~40 bytes), `category_id` (2 bytes), a `rating` (1 byte, stored as rating × 10), an `hours` block (~70 bytes for a week of open/close pairs), `rating_count` (4 bytes), `status` (1 byte), and three bookkeeping fields — `created_at`, `updated_at` (8 bytes each), `version` (4 bytes) — for $194$ bytes of core data. With the 30% row/index overhead typical of a relational store, that is $\approx 252$ bytes/record, or

$$N \cdot 252\text{ B} \approx 47\text{ GiB across all } N = 2\times10^8 \text{ POIs.}$$

Small enough that data volume is never the bottleneck here — QPS and index memory are.

**Spatial index memory.** The read path needs a structure that, given a location, returns nearby POIs without touching the larger, disk-backed primary store. Each entry carries just enough to filter, sort, and render a result: an 8-byte geohash key (Deep dive (a)), an 8-byte `poi_id`, two 4-byte fixed-point coordinates, a 2-byte `category_id`, and a 1-byte rating — $27$ bytes of core data. Packed into a flat, sorted array (not a pointer-heavy tree — Deep dive (a) explains why) with 20% overhead for alignment,

$$N \cdot 27\text{ B} \times 1.2 \approx 6.0\text{ GiB per copy of the index.}$$

Six gibibytes fits comfortably in a single server's memory with room to spare — the decision this unlocks is in Deep dive (c).

**Peak QPS and node count.** At $864{,}000{,}000$ searches/day, average QPS is $864{,}000{,}000 / 86{,}400 = 10{,}000$; with traffic following each region's waking hours, and time zones only partly smoothing the global curve, a 4x peak-to-average ratio gives a peak of $40{,}000$ QPS. Assuming a query-serving node can sustain $2{,}000$ QPS — a 9-cell geohash lookup against the in-memory index, a haversine check on a few hundred candidates, and a sort, all cheap next to network and serialization overhead — the fleet needs $\lceil 40{,}000 / 2{,}000 \rceil = 20$ nodes. Replicating the full 6 GiB index to all 20 (Deep dive (c)) costs about $121$ GiB of cluster memory in total, still cheap.

**Cache.** A popular (block, category) pair repeats heavily — many users near the same block ask for "coffee" within minutes of each other. A cached ranked list would be wrong for the other users in that block, since which POIs qualify and their order depend on the exact query point. So the cache is keyed by the $3\times3$ block (its precision and center cell) and the category; its value is the block's candidates with what the response needs (`poi_id`, fixed-point coordinates, rating, name), and every request, hit or miss, computes distances from its own coordinates. A hit saves the batched name lookup against the primary store. With a 30-second TTL and an assumed 90% hit rate, misses arrive at $10{,}000 \times 0.1 = 1{,}000$/s at average load; by Little's law the cache holds about $1{,}000 \times 30\text{ s} = 30{,}000$ resident keys, each about 200 candidates of 41 bytes plus a header (about 8 KB), for about $240$ MiB — one cache node. The 20-node fleet is still sized for the full *uncached* peak: a cache flush or a cold start cannot be allowed to blow the latency budget.

**Write path.** With 0.5% of $2\times10^8$ POIs changed on an average day, that is $1{,}000{,}000$ changes/day, or $11.57$ writes/sec; fanned out to 20 index replicas, $231$ apply operations/sec — trivial next to the read path. Each change spends about 6 seconds in the indexing pipeline (batching plus delivery to every replica), a twentieth of the 120-second freshness budget, so by Little's law only about $69$ changes are in flight on average; even a 10,000-POI bulk edit drains in 5 seconds across 4 indexing workers at 500/sec each.

### Data model and API

**POI** — `poi_id`, `owner_id`, `name`, `category_id`, `lat`, `lon`, `address`, `hours` (`[{day, open, close}]`, empty for a day the business is closed), `rating`, `rating_count`, `status` (`active | closed`), `version`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. Held in the primary, durable store — the source of truth for every field.

**IndexEntry** — one per POI, held in the in-memory spatial index: `geohash_key` (the point's 9-character geohash, packed as the sort key), `poi_id`, `lat_fixed`, `lon_fixed` (fixed-point integers), `category_id`, `rating_x10`. No `name` or `address`: the response's `name` is filled in by a batched point lookup against the primary store's read replicas when a block's candidates enter the cache.

Core APIs:

- `PUT /pois/{poi_id}` — an owner creates or fully replaces a POI. Body: `{name, category_id, lat, lon, address, hours}`. Written synchronously to the primary store; returns `{poi_id, version}` and queues the change for indexing.
- `PATCH /pois/{poi_id}/hours` — the most frequent owner edit. Body: `{hours}`. Returns `{version}`.
- `DELETE /pois/{poi_id}` — marks the POI `closed` (a tombstone, not a hard delete, so history and disputes stay resolvable). Returns `{status: "closed", effective_at}`.
- `GET /search/nearby?lat&lon&radius_m&category_id?&limit` — every POI within `radius_m` meters, sorted by distance. Returns `[{poi_id, name, category_id, rating, distance_m}]`.
- `GET /search/nearest?lat&lon&k&category_id?` — the exact $K$ nearest POIs, sorted by distance. Same response shape.

A search request carries the client's coordinates, a radius or a $K$, and an optional category; the load balancer routes it to any search-service node, since every node holds a full copy of the geo index. The node picks a geohash precision from the radius (Deep dive (b)) and checks the query-result cache for that block and category. On a miss, it looks up the block's 9 cells in its local in-memory index, fills in the candidates' names with one batched point lookup against a primary-store read replica, and writes them into the cache. Either way it then computes the real haversine distance from the request's own coordinates to every candidate, filters and sorts, and — for a $K$-nearest request — checks a safety margin before returning (Deep dive (b)), moving to a coarser block if the margin or the candidate count is not enough. On the write side, an owner's edit lands in the sharded primary store first and reaches every geo-index replica through the asynchronous indexer and its change log (Deep dive (c)).

### Deep dives

**(a) Spatial index: Geohash vs. QuadTree, and the boundary problem.** Geohash turns a (lat, lon) pair into a short string by bisecting the longitude and latitude ranges in alternation — longitude first — appending a 1 bit whenever the point falls in the upper half of the current range, and packing every 5 bits into one base32 character. A precision-$p$ hash encodes $5p$ bits, split $\lceil 5p/2 \rceil$ to longitude and $\lfloor 5p/2 \rfloor$ to latitude (longitude gets the odd bit, since it goes first), giving a cell of height $180 / 2^{\text{lat bits}}$ degrees and width $360 / 2^{\text{lon bits}}$ degrees. At precision 6 that is $0.61\text{ km} \times 1.22\text{ km}$ at the equator, but a degree of longitude covers less ground further from the equator, so the same cell narrows to about $0.61 \times 0.61\text{ km}$ near latitude 60° ($\cos 60° = 0.5$) — height, tied only to latitude, does not shrink.

Two points sharing a hash prefix are close, but the reverse is false: two points a few meters apart across a cell edge can share no characters at all — on either side of the prime meridian, the very first bisection already separates them. That is the boundary problem, fixed by always searching the $3\times3$ block of the cell plus its 8 neighbors, never the center cell alone. A neighbor is found by decoding the center hash to its bounds, stepping one cell-width or cell-height in the needed direction, wrapping longitude with `((lon + 180) % 360) - 180` so a step east of $+179.99°$ lands near $-179.99°$ across the antimeridian, and re-encoding — correct even for POIs straddling $\pm180°$ longitude. Latitude is clamped at $\pm90°$ instead, so a cell touching a pole simply gets fewer distinct neighbors. Precision itself is chosen from the search radius $r$: the finest precision whose cell height is at least $r/R$ ($R$ the Earth's radius, angles in radians) and whose cell width is at least the disc's longitude half-span $\arcsin(\sin(r/R)/\cos\varphi)$ at the query's latitude $\varphi$ — a little more than $(r/R)/\cos\varphi$ — guarantees the $3\times3$ block covers the search disc even from a corner of the center cell. At latitude 41° a 300 m radius picks precision 6 and a 5 km radius precision 4; at 80° the same 300 m needs precision 5. When no precision qualifies — a radius wider than a continent-sized cell, or a disc that contains a pole — the search scans the whole index: exact, slow, and rare.

QuadTree instead recursively splits a square region into four quadrants only where the point count demands it — a leaf splits once it passes a few hundred points, merging back only once well below that — adapting naturally to density, small leaves downtown and huge ones over farmland. Its search handles the boundary by itself: a best-first traversal visits nodes in order of their minimum distance to the query, so a nearer point just across a leaf edge is reached without a separate neighbor rule. The cost is storage and updates: as a pointer tree in memory, every node carries child pointers and allocator overhead, and an insert can split a leaf, a structural change every replica must reproduce in the same order; stored in a database, leaves have variable-length quadrant codes, so finding a point's leaf is a longest-prefix lookup rather than a fixed-length prefix scan.

Given the index's modest, in-memory size and a write-light, read-heavy workload, QuadTree's extra adaptivity is not worth that complexity: Geohash, as the flat sorted array already priced above, is the choice. Its downside — one unusually dense cell (a stadium, a mall) still over-returning at a fine precision — is handled locally, with a deeper override just for that prefix, rather than adopting QuadTree's adaptivity everywhere for a few hot spots. Hierarchical spherical grids such as S2 and H3 avoid Geohash's distortion near the poles and in cell shape, at the cost of a heavier dependency.

**(b) Exact radius and $K$-nearest search.** Neither a shared hash prefix nor grid adjacency is a distance — only the real, decoded coordinates are — so the $3\times3$ candidate set above is always followed by an exact haversine distance to every candidate, and only that distance decides inclusion or rank. A radius query stops there: the precision was chosen so the block covers the whole search disc (and when none can, the whole index is scanned), so nothing outside it can be within the radius, and the filtered, sorted list is already exact and complete.

$K$-nearest is harder, since there is no radius to size the block from up front. The search starts from a default radius (a density guess, e.g. 1 km), gathers that block's candidates, sorts by real distance, and checks a safety margin before returning: a lower bound on the distance from the query point to anything outside the $3\times3$ block. An edge of latitude is a parallel, reached most quickly due north or south, at $R \cdot \Delta\varphi$; an edge of longitude is a meridian, a great circle, at $R\arcsin(\cos\varphi \sin\Delta\lambda)$ — shorter than the $R\cos\varphi \cdot \Delta\lambda$ measured along the query's parallel, by 3.4 km at latitude 60° with $\Delta\lambda = 11.75°$, enough to return a wrong nearest POI. If the $K$-th best distance is no more than the smallest of the four edge distances, nothing outside the block could be closer and the answer is exact. Otherwise, with at least $K$ candidates, the $K$-th distance so far is an upper bound on the true one, so the next round uses the block the precision rule picks for that radius, which is guaranteed to pass; with fewer than $K$ it goes one precision coarser. A coarser block contains the finer one, and below precision 1 the search scans the whole index, so the loop always ends with the exact answer — the $K$ nearest, or every matching POI when fewer than $K$ exist.

Against an independent full scan over 600 queries — in a metro area, at latitude 70°, in a sparse region at 62–78° S, and across $\pm180°$, two thirds of them next to a cell corner — both searches match exactly; in $33$ of them the first block already held $K$ candidates while a nearer POI lay outside it.

**(c) Replication vs. sharding, hot shards, and freshness.** Because the whole spatial index is only about 6 GiB, it is replicated read-only, in full, to every one of the 20 query-serving nodes — not sharded by region. Sharding the index (say, by geohash prefix) would save memory this design does not need, at the cost of a real problem: a query whose 9 cells cross a shard boundary would need some of them from a different machine. With geohash-4 shards that is one query in eight at precision 6 (124 of the 1,024 precision-6 cells in a geohash-4 cell sit on its rim), five in eight at precision 5, and every query at precision 4 or coarser, each one a cross-machine fan-out. Replication avoids that entirely — and a dense city's queries spread over all 20 nodes like any others — at $20\times$ the memory (about 121 GiB fleet-wide, still cheap) and $20\times$ the write fan-out (231 apply operations/sec, still trivial).

The primary POI store is sharded for a different reason: write isolation and blast radius, not memory (its 47 GiB total is nowhere near a bottleneck). Sharding by a geohash-4 prefix keeps a region's POIs on nearby shards for low-latency regional writes — but a fixed-length prefix is exactly what creates a hot shard: a prefix over a dense downtown holds far more POIs and writes than the same-length prefix over open countryside. If an average non-empty geohash-4 prefix holds on the order of 1,000 POIs, one at ten times that ($10{,}000$) is split into its 32 geohash-5 children, each becoming its own range; ranges, large and small, are packed onto a handful of machines, and a request routes through a small shard map by longest-prefix match rather than a fixed prefix length.

Freshness comes from a short write-path critical section: an owner's edit is durably committed to the primary store first — the source of truth — and only then does an asynchronous indexer batch it, recompute its geohash key if coordinates changed, and append the delta to an ordered change log that every index replica consumes, off the query path entirely. A replica cannot insert into its packed sorted array in place, which would shift gigabytes, so it applies deltas to a small overlay searched alongside the array — new versions of changed entries in a sorted side table, and the `poi_id`s whose array entries are stale in a tombstone set — and every 10 minutes merges the two into a fresh array and swaps it in; by then the overlay holds only about $7{,}000$ changes. Each replica reports its log offset, the load balancer drains one that falls more than 60 seconds behind, and a restarted replica loads the latest array snapshot and replays the log from that snapshot's offset. At most 60 seconds of lag plus the cache's 30-second TTL stays inside the 2-minute target even during a 10,000-POI bulk edit, which is why eventual consistency — a POI briefly still showing open after closing — is an acceptable trade against a synchronous index write on the write path.

### Follow-ups

- A client that keeps moving (walking, driving) could be sent every POI within $r + d$ and re-filter locally until it has moved more than $d$ — exact by the triangle inequality — cutting backend QPS well under the peak this design provisions for.
- A category with fewer than $K$ POIs worldwide sends every $K$-nearest query for it to the full scan; per-category counts kept by the indexer let such a query go straight to that category's short list.
