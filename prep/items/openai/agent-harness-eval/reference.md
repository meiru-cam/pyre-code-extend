Two points worth confirming before designing: whether every tool backend can accept an idempotency key (otherwise the harness cannot safely retry a mutating call on its behalf), and whether the evaluation environment must be fully offline and replayable or may include a few tasks that call live external services. The design below assumes most tools support an idempotency key, and that the evaluation suite runs against recorded or mocked tool responses.

### Requirements and scale

**Concurrency.** At $\lambda_{\text{avg}} = 20$ runs/sec and a step latency of 900 ms for the completion call plus tool time on the 70% of steps that call one, the blended tool latency is

$$0.2 \times 1.9\text{s} + 0.8 \times 0.15\text{s} = 0.5\text{s},$$

so a step averages $0.9 + 0.7 \times 0.5 = 1.25$ s and a 12-step run averages $12 \times 1.25 = 15$ s wall-clock. By Little's law, $L = \lambda W$ gives $20 \times 15 = 300$ runs in flight on average and $60 \times 15 = 900$ at the 3x peak — the number the orchestrator's worker pool must hold concurrently, not the arrival rate itself.

**Tool-call and sandbox rate.** $20 \times 12 = 240$ steps/sec on average (720 at peak); at 70% of steps calling a tool, that is 168 tool calls/sec on average and 504 at peak. One in five of those goes through the isolated sandbox, so $504 \times 0.2 \approx 101$ sandboxed calls/sec at peak; each occupies a sandbox for 1.9 s on average, so Little's law again gives $101 \times 1.9 \approx 192$ sandboxes needed concurrently at peak. A warm pool sized at about 250 (30% headroom) avoids paying a cold microVM start (roughly 150 ms) on the hot path for most calls.

**Trajectory storage.** Each step's recorded turn is roughly 3 KB: 1.2 KB of model output, 1.4 KB of tool input/output averaged over the 70% of steps that have any ($2\text{KB} \times 0.7$), and 0.4 KB of metadata (timestamps, token counts, tool id). A 12-step run is $12 \times 3\text{KB} = 36$ KB, and at 1.73 million runs/day the harness writes about 62.2 GB/day. A 14-day hot retention window for live debugging is then about 871 GB.

**Eval scheduling.** Grading a stochastic agent on one run is noisy, so both suites run each task 3 times: the nightly suite is $2{,}000 \times 3 = 6{,}000$ runs, and the smoke suite is $200 \times 3 = 600$ runs. An eval run is not much cheaper than a production one — the model still costs 900 ms per step and sandboxed tasks still execute for real; only the fast scoped calls are replayed from the snapshot, which trims a run to $12 \times (0.9 + 0.7 \times 0.2 \times 1.9) = 14.0$ s. Sizing at the production 15 s/run, fitting the nightly suite inside a 45-minute budget needs at least $\lceil 6{,}000 \times 15 / 2{,}700 \rceil = 34$ concurrent workers (provisioned at 40), and the smoke suite inside an 8-minute PR-feedback budget needs at least $\lceil 600 \times 15 / 480 \rceil = 19$ (provisioned at 24, on a small reserved lane so a busy production peak of 900 runs never starves a PR check).

### Data model and API

The six core abstractions map directly onto this model: a **task** is a `Task` row; its **context** is not stored on its own but reconstructed the way the trajectory deep dive describes; a **tool** is a `ToolDef`; the **trajectory** is the ordered sequence of `Step` rows for a `Run`; a run's **state** is the small amount of mutable bookkeeping the orchestrator carries while it is in flight — retry counts, the current consecutive-failure streak per tool signature, tokens and cost spent so far — kept on the `Run` row itself, separate from the append-only trajectory; and the **termination condition** is the policy checked after every step: an explicit finish action, `max_steps`, `wall_clock_timeout_s`, a safety halt, or `tool_loop`.

**Task** — `task_id`, `caller` (`production` or an eval suite id), `goal` (the instruction given to the model), `tool_allowlist`, `env_snapshot_ref` (a pointer to the starting environment — for an eval task, recorded or mocked tool responses; for a production task, nothing beyond live credentials), `max_steps`, `wall_clock_timeout_s`, `golden_check_ref` (set only for eval tasks, pointing at the grading function or rubric).

**Run** — one execution attempt of a task: `run_id`, `task_id`, `model_version`, `harness_version`, `status` (`running | finished | timed_out | aborted`), `stop_reason` (`finish_action | max_steps | wall_clock | safety_halt | tool_loop`), `retry_count`, `failure_streak` (the live per-tool-signature consecutive-failure count), `started_at`, `finished_at`, `total_tokens`, `cost_usd`.

**Step** — the unit of the trajectory: `run_id`, `step_index`, `role` (`assistant | tool`), `content_ref` (a pointer into blob storage for anything over a size threshold, inline otherwise), `tool_call` (`{tool_id, args, idempotency_key}` or null), `tool_result` (`{status, error_class, latency_ms, result_ref}` or null), `token_usage`, `timestamp`.

**ToolDef** — `tool_id`, `version`, `json_schema` (the arguments schema), `side_effect_class` (`read_only | mutating`), `isolation` (`sandboxed | scoped_token`), `timeout_ms`, `retryable`.

**EvalResult** — `run_id`, `grader` (`programmatic | llm_judge | human`), `dimension_scores` (`{success, tool_quality, cost, latency, safety, stability}`), `judge_version`, `graded_at`.

Core APIs:

- `POST /tasks/{task_id}/runs` — start a run, in `production` or `eval` mode. Body: `{model_version, harness_version, mode}`. Returns `{run_id, status: "running"}`.
- `POST /tools/{tool_id}/invoke` — the harness-internal call the orchestrator makes on the model's behalf; validates the args against the tool's schema, applies its timeout, isolation and retry policy, and returns `{status, result_ref, error_class?, latency_ms}`.
- `GET /runs/{run_id}/trajectory` — the ordered, paginated list of steps for a run, used by the debugging UI and by the replay engine.
- `POST /eval-suites/{suite_id}/runs` — trigger a suite run (a nightly cron or a CI webhook) at a given `model_version`/`harness_version` with `repeats`. Returns `{suite_run_id, status}`.
- `GET /eval-suites/{suite_id}/runs/{suite_run_id}/report` — per-task and suite-wide dimension scores, plus a diff against the suite's historical baseline; CI reads this to decide pass/fail.

```

A production caller or an eval runner starts a run at the orchestrator, which owns the task's context and mutable state. The orchestrator sends the current context to the completion API; when the model's turn requests a tool, the tool gateway validates the call against that tool's schema and dispatches it to either the sandbox pool (code execution) or a scoped-token backend (internal APIs, search), enforcing the tool's timeout and retry policy before returning a structured result. The orchestrator appends every model turn and tool result to the trajectory store as it goes, then loops back to the completion API with the updated context, until a termination condition fires. An eval runner drives the identical orchestrator path against a fixed environment snapshot instead of live traffic; once a run ends, the grader reads its trajectory from the store and writes dimension scores that feed straight into the regression dashboard.

### Deep dives

**Tool-call isolation, timeouts, retries, and error propagation.** Two isolation tiers cover the tool mix: arbitrary or model-influenced code runs inside an ephemeral sandbox (ejected and destroyed after one call), while calls into internal APIs and search go out with a short-lived, per-call credential scoped to exactly the resource and operation the tool declares, with a TTL matched to the tool's timeout. Sandboxing every tool uniformly would be simpler, but pays the sandbox's cold-start and memory cost on calls already access-controlled by their own backend; the scoped-token path instead trusts that backend's own authorization, since the harness cannot see what happens once the call leaves it.

Every tool declares its own timeout (5 s default for a scoped API call, a hard 30 s kill for the sandbox); a step's own timeout is that value plus a small margin, and the run-level caps above (`max_steps`, wall-clock) bound the worst case even if every step is slow. Retries are attempted only for error classes that are safe to repeat — a timeout or a connection error, never a schema-validation failure, since retrying an identical malformed call cannot fix it and just burns a step; a mutating tool additionally requires an idempotency key, derived from `(run_id, step_index, tool_id)` so it stays stable across retries of the *same* call without being reusable across a genuinely new one, and the backend dedupes on it. Up to 2 retries run with an exponential backoff (250 ms, doubling, ±20% jitter). Letting the model itself retry by just calling the tool again was considered and rejected: a model-issued duplicate call carries no stable idempotency key, so a retried mutating action can double-apply its effect; the harness owns every retry of anything with a side effect and shows the model only the final outcome.

A tool's error is appended to the trajectory as a structured observation — `error_class` plus the real backend message, never paraphrased — so the model can react appropriately: fix the arguments on a validation error, try a different tool on a permission error, or move on after the harness reports that a timeout already exhausted its retries. Three consecutive failures with the same tool signature (same `tool_id` and equivalent arguments) abort the run with `stop_reason = tool_loop` rather than let a stuck agent spin until the wall-clock timeout.

**Trajectory recording and replay.** A trajectory is an append-only sequence of steps, each stored once; anything above a size threshold (a large search result, a file diff) is written to blob storage and the step keeps only a reference. Reconstructing the exact context sent to the model at any step is done by concatenating the stored turns with the versioned system prompt and tool definitions used at that time — not by re-storing the whole, ever-growing context at every step. That distinction matters: storing a full context snapshot at each of $k = 12$ steps would repeat every earlier turn each time, for $k(k+1)/2 = 78$ turn-equivalents per run instead of 12 — a $6.5\times$ ($=(k+1)/2$) blow-up over the delta-based 36 KB/run computed above, from the storage choice alone.

Replaying a historical run against a new model version re-feeds each recorded `tool_result` verbatim rather than re-invoking the tool: this isolates whether the *model's* behavior changed from whether the *environment* changed, since a search index or a ticketing system returning different results later would otherwise make a real regression look fixed, or the reverse, for reasons unrelated to the model.

Keeping every run at full fidelity forever is not worth its storage: at 62.2 GB/day, a year of everything is about 22.7 TB. Instead, the 14-day hot window (871 GB) covers live debugging, and long-term storage keeps only every failed run plus a 5% sample of successful ones, sampled by hashing `run_id` (not re-randomized daily, so the same cohort stays sampled over time for drift tracking). With an 8% production failure rate, that keeps $0.08 + 0.92 \times 0.05 = 12.6\%$ of runs, cutting annual long-term storage to about 2.86 TB, a $7.9\times$ reduction, without losing a single failure to debug. Sampling individual *steps* instead of whole runs was rejected: a trajectory with some steps kept and others dropped cannot be replayed end to end, so the unit of sampling has to be the run.

**Evaluation: datasets, grading, and regression testing.** Each eval task fixes its starting environment (a seeded filesystem, or recorded/mocked tool responses) so the run is reproducible; a live external dependency changing between two eval runs would otherwise be indistinguishable from a real regression. A small separate "integration" lane hits live services for the handful of tasks that need to, run less often and never gating a merge. Grading splits by task type: objective tasks (a file edited correctly, a test suite passing) get a programmatic check against a golden final state; open-ended tasks get an LLM judge against a fixed rubric with few-shot calibration examples, itself checked weekly against a 200-task human-graded sample and recalibrated whenever agreement drops below 90%.

Each run is scored on six dimensions, kept separate rather than blended into one number: task success (the rubric or golden-state score), tool-call quality (the fraction of calls passing schema validation, and the fraction redundant given the run's own history), cost (token spend and tool compute cost tracked separately, since a token-cheap run can still be sandbox-expensive), latency (wall-clock), safety (actions a separate safety classifier flags as disallowed), and stability (agreement across the 3 repeats of a task — wide disagreement there is an unreliable-agent problem, not necessarily a wrong-agent one).

The eval store is access-controlled separately from whatever pipeline curates prompts or training data; every eval task carries a unique canary string, so grepping a prompt bundle or a training shard says at once whether the suite has leaked into it, and a shingled-MinHash near-duplicate check (flagged above 0.8 Jaccard) catches an eval item that was reworded rather than copied. The 2,000-task suite splits into a 1,500-task dev subset, fine to read while iterating on the harness or its prompts, and a 500-task held-out subset scored only weekly and never inspected otherwise; a growing gap between the two scores is the signal that work has started overfitting to the visible dev subset. Every PR runs the smoke suite (600 runs, 24 reserved workers, 8-minute budget) and blocks the merge when its mean success rate falls more than two standard errors below the rolling baseline. The independent unit there is the task, not the run — a task's 3 repeats are correlated — so at a 75% baseline that error is $\sqrt{0.75 \times 0.25 / 200} \approx 0.031$ — 3.1 points — and the gate catches only regressions past roughly 6 points; the nightly suite's 2,000 tasks cut the same error to 0.97 points, so a slow two-point slide is caught overnight, on the dashboard and on-call's pager. Because every trajectory is retained, a failing task is localized to the earliest step where its own checkpoints (when it defines any) diverge from golden, or, absent those, to the earliest step the judge flags as where things went wrong, so debugging starts there.

### Follow-ups

- A run that keeps calling the model without ever finishing or calling a tool is already caught by `max_steps` and the wall-clock timeout; it needs no separate detection.
- A sub-agent spawned by another agent reuses the same `Run`/`Step` schema with a `parent_run_id`, so nested trajectories fall out of the existing data model.
- A tool backend that only degrades under load needs its retry policy to read a shared, per-`tool_id` circuit breaker rather than each run backing off independently, or thousands of concurrent runs retry the same failing backend at once and make the outage worse.
- Comparing two harness versions on live traffic is an online A/B split scored on the same six dimensions; the offline suite's job is to keep a version that would lose badly from reaching that experiment at all.
- Human grading capacity, not model capability, is the real bottleneck on adding a new task category: its judge cannot be trusted until a fresh calibration batch has been human-graded for it.
