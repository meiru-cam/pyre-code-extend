Two points worth confirming first: whether a user can have more than one rewrite panel open at once, and how much surrounding context goes into the prompt. This design allows several concurrent requests per user within their budget and sends a fixed window of surrounding text, not the whole document.

### Requirements and scale

**Request rate.** $1{,}200{,}000$ requests/day average to $\approx 13.9$ requests/sec; at 5x that for the daily peak, peak submissions run at $\approx 69.4$ requests/sec.

**Service time and concurrency.** Time to first token (400 ms) plus decode time for the average 180 output tokens at 35 tokens/sec, $W = 0.4 + 180/35 \approx 5.54$ s — the time one request occupies a model-serving concurrency slot. By Little's law, $L = \lambda \cdot W$: at peak, $L_{\text{peak}} = 69.4 \times 5.54 \approx 385$ concurrent streams.

**GPU replicas needed.** At 20 concurrent streams per replica, $385 / 20 \approx 19.2$ replicas cover peak load exactly; with 20% headroom for instances warming up or failing a health check, $19.2 \times 1.2 \approx 23.1$, rounded up to **24 replicas**, draining $24 \times 20 / 5.54 \approx 86.6$ requests/sec — peak load runs it at $\approx 80\%$ utilization.

**Egress bandwidth.** Each token leaves as its own SSE event (`id:`, `event:`, and a short JSON `data:` line, about 55 bytes) plus HTTP/2 and TLS framing, about 100 bytes on the wire. Peak egress is $385 \times 35 \times 100 \approx 1.35$ MB/s, about 11 Mbps — negligible.

**Daily token cost.** $1{,}200{,}000$ requests/day at 220 input and 180 output tokens average to $264{,}000{,}000$ input and $216{,}000{,}000$ output tokens/day; at the given \$0.05 and \$0.15 per 1,000 tokens, that is \$13,200 + \$32,400 = **\$45,600/day**, about \$0.038/request.

**At 10x.** $12{,}000{,}000$ requests/day put peak submissions at $\approx 694$/sec, concurrent streams at $\approx 3{,}849$, and the replica count at $\approx 231$, at $\approx$ \$456,000/day ($\approx$ \$166M/year). The GPU pool is the first bottleneck: it grows linearly, costs the most, and has a procurement lead time. Next is whatever grows with tokens rather than requests: the event buffer takes one append per token, $3{,}849 \times 35 \approx 135{,}000$/sec at 10x peak, so it is sharded by `request_id`, and the request store is written only at state transitions, never per token. The edge, admission control, and SSE gateway just add instances. The design changes are the per-user cost quota and a larger default share of traffic on the smaller degrade-ladder model below.

### Data model and API

**RewriteRequest** — `request_id`, `user_id`, `document_id`, `idempotency_key` (unique per `user_id`), `instruction_type` (`improve | shorten | lengthen | fix_grammar | custom`), `instruction_text` (`custom` only), `input_tokens`, `output_token_cap` (400 here, about twice the average output), `status` (`queued | admitted | streaming | completed | cancelled | failed`), `cancel_requested`, `orchestrator_id`, `model_replica_id`, `output_tokens`, `output_text`, `cost_usd`, `created_at`, `completed_at`.

**StreamEvent** — in an in-memory event buffer shared by all gateway instances and keyed by `request_id`, which holds a request's whole stream (at most `output_token_cap` + 1 events) until a few minutes after its terminal event: `request_id`, `seq` (also sent as the SSE `id`), `type` (`token | done | error`), `payload`, `emitted_at`.

**RateBudget** — `user_id`, `balance_usd` (the bucket's level, in chargeback cost), `holds` (`{request_id: (amount_usd, expires_at)}` for in-flight requests), `last_refill_at`, `daily_cost_cap_usd`.

Core API:

- `POST /v1/rewrites` — `{document_id, selection_text, context_text, instruction_type, instruction_text?, idempotency_key}` → `202 {request_id, status, stream_url}`; `429` when the user's budget or daily quota cannot cover the hold, `503` when the queue and the fallback pool are both full, each with a `Retry-After` header.
- `GET /v1/rewrites/{request_id}/stream` — an SSE endpoint; replays buffered events after `Last-Event-ID` (sent by `EventSource` on reconnect) or `?after=<seq>` (on a connection the client opens itself), then follows live ones. Emits `token` (`{seq, text}`), `done` (`{finish_reason, output_tokens}`), and `error` (`{code, message, retryable}`) events.
- `POST /v1/rewrites/{request_id}/cancel` — idempotent; sets `cancel_requested` and signals the orchestrator holding the model call. Returns the resulting `status`.
- `GET /v1/rewrites/{request_id}` — current `status`, plus `output_tokens` and `output_text` once `completed`; used after a page reload.

```

A submission lands at the API edge, which authenticates it and hands it to admission control. A known `(user_id, idempotency_key)` returns the existing request. Otherwise admission control places a hold on the caller's `RateBudget`, checks queue depth, and inserts the `RewriteRequest` row under a unique constraint on that pair before acknowledging, so the client never holds a `request_id` the store has no record of (a concurrent duplicate that loses the insert releases its hold). The orchestrator takes the request from the queue, assembles the prompt (the shared system and preset-instruction prefix first, then context, selection, and any custom instruction), and opens a streaming call to the model-serving pool, claiming a concurrency slot. It appends each token to the event buffer; the SSE gateway tails the buffer and forwards new events, and because the buffer lives outside the gateway, a reconnect can land on any gateway instance. On completion the orchestrator writes `output_tokens`, `output_text`, and `cost_usd`, settles the hold, and a `done` event closes the stream.

What to watch: submit-to-first-rendered-token time and stream completion rate, measured in the client (a buffering proxy shows up only there); per-replica time to first token and tokens/sec, apart from queue wait; queue depth against a flat pool; `429`, `503`, and cancellation rates; `cost_usd` by `instruction_type`, where a prompt change that lengthens outputs shows up before the monthly bill. Every hop tags its logs with `request_id`, so one trace shows a slow or failed rewrite's admission decision, queue wait, replica, and token timings.

### Deep dives

**Streaming transport and cancellation.**

- *WebSocket*: full duplex, worth it when the client streams messages up or the server pushes events nobody asked for. Here the only client-to-server signal after submission is an occasional cancel, which a plain `POST` carries; a WebSocket would also need its own resume protocol, and some enterprise proxies block the `Upgrade` handshake.
- *SSE* (chosen): one-directional, server to client, which is all this feature needs; it rides ordinary HTTP with no `Upgrade` to block, as long as every proxy on the path passes the response through unbuffered, or tokens arrive in batches. `EventSource` reconnects on its own and sends the last `id` it saw as `Last-Event-ID`, so the gateway replays only the missed events. It issues only `GET`s and cannot set request headers (identity rides on a cookie or a signed `stream_url`), hence the split between `POST` to create and `GET` to stream, at the price of one extra round trip; a `POST` that streams its own response must be read with `fetch`, without the built-in reconnect. Over HTTP/1.1 browsers allow only six connections per host across all tabs; HTTP/2 multiplexes the streams over one.

Cancellation is a separate `POST /cancel`, since SSE has no client-to-server direction. It sets `cancel_requested` (a still-`queued` request just leaves the queue) and calls the orchestrator recorded on the row, which closes its streaming call; the model service then stops that stream at its next decode step and frees the slot, so the metered generation actually stops. A dropped connection without a cancel (a closed tab) takes the same path after a grace window long enough for a page reload. If the orchestrator dies, its calls close with it; a sweeper releases the expired hold in full and marks the request `failed`.

**Admission control, overload, and cost control.** Two decisions sit in front of the model pool: how much a user may spend, and what happens when the pool is full.

- *Per-request rate limiting*: simple, but "expand this into three paragraphs" and "fix this typo" cost very different GPU time, so counting requests bounds neither a user's spend nor a heavy user's share of the pool.
- *Cost-weighted token bucket* (chosen): denominated in chargeback cost. At admission a request holds its known input cost plus `output_token_cap` worth of output (\$0.071, against an average actual \$0.038); when the stream ends the hold settles to the actual cost — authorize-then-settle, as in a card payment. Removing the hold and deducting the cost is one update of the user's record, so settling twice is a no-op. A cancelled request pays for the tokens generated, a serving-side failure pays nothing, and a hold past `expires_at` (the longest possible generation plus margin) is released in full. Cost: budget sits reserved during the generation, in exchange for an exact spend bound.

A request that clears the budget check still needs a free concurrency slot.

- *Unbounded queue*: never rejects, but a request that joins behind $n$ others waits for $n$ slots to free, which a full pool does at its drain rate $\mu \approx 86.6$ requests/sec, so $W_q \approx n / \mu$. A surge to 100 requests/sec grows the queue by $100 - \mu \approx 13$ per second; two minutes of it leave about 1,600 entries, a 19-second wait, for an answer that is stale by then and still costs a full generation.
- *Bounded queue* (chosen): the same relation sets the cap, $L_q = \mu \cdot W_q$ for a 2-s wait target, $86.6 \times 2 \approx 173$, rounded down to 150 and recomputed from the live count of healthy replicas. A request past the cap is degraded: first to a smaller, faster model on its own always-available pool, lower quality but a complete answer; if that pool is saturated too, `503` with a jittered `Retry-After` of a few seconds (a full queue drains in $150 / 86.6 \approx 1.7$ s), so rejected clients do not return in lockstep.

Beyond admission: a cache of whole responses keyed on the prompt would almost never hit, since selections and their context differ across documents, *Try again* must draw a new sample anyway, and a resent click is already answered by the idempotency key. What repeats is the head of the prompt, the system and preset instructions, whose key-value (KV) cache the model service can reuse instead of recomputing. A hit needs the prompt to match the cached prefix token for token from its first token (a timestamp placed ahead of it defeats it) and the cache to be resident on the serving replica; with a handful of distinct prefixes, every replica keeps them all warm. It saves prefill compute and time to first token for those tokens only; decode, about 5.1 s of each 5.5-s slot, is untouched, so the replica count barely moves. `cost_usd` also rolls up per user against a daily quota separate from the bucket, a ceiling even for a user who never exceeds the rate.

**Frontend rendering and error recovery.**

- *Re-parse and re-render the whole text on each event*: simple and always consistent, but total work grows quadratically with length, and a resume that replays a few hundred buffered events at once triggers a few hundred full renders in one burst.
- *Append-only incremental rendering* (chosen): events append to a text buffer and at most one render per animation frame consumes what has arrived, so a replay burst costs one render. Only the block still being written is re-parsed, and a construct not yet closed (an open code fence, an unmatched bold marker) is rendered as if closed, so no stray asterisk or broken code block flashes. `done` triggers one full re-parse.

An interrupted stream can resume or restart. *Resume* fits a transport-only failure: `EventSource`'s own reconnect sends `Last-Event-ID`, a connection the client reopens passes `?after=` with the last rendered `seq`, and the gateway replays the buffered events after it while the model, if still running, keeps writing into the buffer; this works while the request is `streaming` or `completed` and its buffer entry is alive. *Restart* fits a failed request (the replica crashed, the store says `failed` or `cancelled`): the reconnect gets an `error` event at once and the client offers a fresh attempt. On `done` the client closes its `EventSource`, which would otherwise reconnect as soon as the response ends.

Errors are shown by what they call for: a transient failure (a dropped stream, a gateway error) retries with backoff behind a "reconnecting…" state; `429` and `503` show the wait and a manual retry that honors `Retry-After`; a permanent failure (a content-policy rejection, a malformed selection) shows a non-retryable message. A resend of the same `POST` (its response was lost) carries the `idempotency_key` minted at the click, and the unique constraint on `(user_id, idempotency_key)` returns the existing request rather than starting, and billing, a second generation. *Try again* and a restart after `failed` use a new key; the failed attempt's hold was already released, so nothing is charged twice.

### Follow-ups

- Accepting replaces the selection only if its range still holds the original text; a collaborator may have edited it while the rewrite streamed, in which case the panel offers to insert the rewrite instead.
