One point worth confirming before designing: whether a newly registered endpoint should receive events older than its subscription (assumed no).

### Requirements and scale

**Delivery throughput.** $E = 216\times10^6$ events/day average to $E / 86{,}400 = 2{,}500$ events/sec. At an average fan-out of $f = 3$ subscribed endpoints per event, baseline deliveries are $D = E \cdot f = 648\times10^6$/day, or $D / 86{,}400 = 7{,}500$/sec on average. A 3x peak-to-average ratio puts the design point at $7{,}500 \times 3 = 22{,}500$ deliveries/sec.

**Concurrency, by response-time tier.** Little's law, $L = \lambda W$, gives the number of requests in flight at once, where $W$ is the *full* hold time — including a request that never answers and simply times out. Splitting the peak rate by tier:

- Tier: Healthy · Share of traffic: 90% · Hold time $W$: 0.2 s · $\lambda$ at peak: 20,250/s · $L = \lambda W$: 4,050 · Share of $L$: 29%
- Tier: Slow · Share of traffic: 8% · Hold time $W$: 3 s · $\lambda$ at peak: 1,800/s · $L = \lambda W$: 5,400 · Share of $L$: 39%
- Tier: Dead (timeout) · Share of traffic: 2% · Hold time $W$: 10 s · $\lambda$ at peak: 450/s · $L = \lambda W$: 4,500 · Share of $L$: 32%

Total $L_{peak} \approx 13{,}950$ requests in flight. The last two rows are the point: 10% of traffic (slow and dead) holds 71% of that concurrency.

**Workers.** Budgeting $c = 200$ concurrent connections per worker (an async event loop, not one OS thread per request), $\lceil 13{,}950 / 200 \rceil = 70$ workers cover the peak; a 15% margin for bursts rounds that to 81, or 16,200 slots.

**Retry traffic.** Take the first-attempt failure rate as 3% (a blend across the tiers, mostly the dead tier), with 1.5 more attempts on average before success or dead-lettering: $648\times10^6 \times 0.03 \times 1.5 = 29.16\times10^6$ extra attempts/day, 337.5/sec — about 4.5% on top of the 7,500/sec baseline. In slots they weigh far more, since a retry goes back to an endpoint that just failed: at the 3x peak, 1,012.5 retries/sec all running to the 10 s timeout would hold 10,125 slots, against 2,250 left over. The 81 workers suffice only because the circuit breaker (deep dive (b)) makes most retries to a dead endpoint fail at once, holding no slot.

**Storage.** Events are kept 14 days (long enough to replay a fan-out bug, short enough to bound cost) at roughly 2.2 KB/row: $216\times10^6 \times 14 \times 2{,}200 \text{ B} \approx 6.1$ TiB. Delivery records, one row per (event, endpoint) that retries update in place, are kept 30 days at roughly 150 B/row: $648\times10^6 \times 30 \times 150 \text{ B} \approx 2.7$ TiB. A sharded relational store holds both and gives the delivery records the conditional single-row updates and secondary indexes they need.

### Data model and API

**Endpoint** — `endpoint_id`, `tenant_id`, `callback_url`, `signing_secret_current`, `signing_secret_previous` (null outside a rotation grace window), `secret_rotated_at`, `status` (`active | paused | disabled_after_failures`), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

**EndpointEventType** — `endpoint_id`, `tenant_id` (denormalized, so fan-out never joins back to `Endpoint`), `event_type`. Unique `(endpoint_id, event_type)`; index `(tenant_id, event_type, endpoint_id)` directly serves the fan-out query for "every active endpoint of this tenant subscribed to this event type."

**Event** — `event_id` (producer-generated, globally unique), `tenant_id`, `event_type`, `sequence` (per tenant, assigned by the event store in the insert's transaction), `payload` (JSON), `created_at`, `fanned_out_at` (null until every delivery row for the event exists). The unique index on `event_id` makes a producer's retried submission idempotent; an index on events without `fanned_out_at` feeds fan-out.

**Delivery** — `delivery_id` (stable across every attempt, sent to the receiver inside the signed body), `event_id`, `endpoint_id`, `state` (`pending | claimed | delivered | dead`), `attempt_count` (incremented by each claim), `lease_token` (a fresh value minted on each claim), `lease_deadline`, `next_retry_at` (when a `pending` row is next due), `last_response_code`, `last_error`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. Unique `(event_id, endpoint_id)` makes fan-out idempotent — inserting the same pair twice is a no-op. Indexes `(state, next_retry_at)` and `(state, lease_deadline)` serve the scheduler's two scans; `(endpoint_id, state)` serves the history API's `status` filter. The queue message carries `attempt_count` alongside `delivery_id`, so checking the remaining retry budget costs no database read, and a stale message is recognized at claim time.

Core APIs:

- `POST /endpoints` — `{callback_url, event_types}` → `{endpoint_id, status: "active", signing_secret}` (the secret is returned exactly once).
- `PATCH /endpoints/{endpoint_id}` — `{callback_url?, event_types?, status?, action?}`; `action: "rotate_secret"` returns a fresh `{signing_secret}` and keeps the old one valid as a second signature for 24 hours.
- `DELETE /endpoints/{endpoint_id}` — stops future deliveries; existing delivery records are kept for their retention window.
- `GET /endpoints/{endpoint_id}/deliveries?status=dead&limit=50&cursor=...` — paginated history.
- `POST /deliveries/{delivery_id}/replay` — re-queues a `delivered` or `dead` delivery under the same `delivery_id` with a fresh attempt budget. Returns `{delivery_id, state: "pending"}`.

```

The registration API writes a tenant's endpoint and its event-type subscriptions to the endpoint store. An internal service calls the ingestion API with a tenant id, an event type, and a payload, and the event is committed to the event store before the call is acknowledged. The fan-out worker takes an event whose `fanned_out_at` is null, inserts one `pending` delivery row per subscribed active endpoint, pushes each onto the ready queue (this direct push keeps first attempts within 2 s), and then sets `fanned_out_at`. A delivery worker pulls a message, takes a slot for the endpoint in the slot store, claims the delivery under a lease, sends the signed POST, and records the outcome together with the next retry time. The retry scheduler scans the delivery records for rows that are due — an elapsed backoff or an expired lease — and pushes them back onto the ready queue; the same records back the history and replay APIs.

### Deep dives

**At-least-once delivery and idempotency.** The ingestion API commits the event *before* acknowledging the caller: a crash between accepting the request and that commit leaves nothing behind, and the caller's retry with the same `event_id`, absorbed by its unique index, is the right recovery. The reverse order, acknowledge then persist, loses every event whose crash falls between the two steps, after the caller has been told it was accepted.

The event store and the delivery records are separate stores, so fan-out is not part of the event's transaction, and it does not need to be. `fanned_out_at` is set only after every delivery row exists, so a fan-out worker that dies midway leaves the event to be picked up again; the re-run inserts only the missing rows (the unique `(event_id, endpoint_id)` index turns the rest into no-ops) and pushes every row again. Setting the marker first would let a crash lose the remaining endpoints' deliveries for good.

A queue message only names a row; the row decides. Every `pending` row carries a `next_retry_at` — a minute out for a fresh row, the backoff time after a failure — so a message lost to a crash only delays its delivery until the scheduler's scan finds the row. A claim is one conditional update: it succeeds only if the row is still at the message's `attempt_count` and is `pending` (or `claimed` under an expired lease), and it increments `attempt_count` and mints a fresh `lease_token` with a 30 s lease, three times the request timeout. A duplicate or stale message therefore fails its claim and is dropped, and a delivery that crashes its worker every time still runs out of attempts; one whose last attempt loses its lease is dead-lettered by the scheduler.

Recording the outcome and scheduling the next attempt are one write under `WHERE lease_token = <mine>`: `delivered`, `dead`, or `pending` with the new `next_retry_at`. As two writes — say, a record followed by a push onto a separate retry queue — a crash between them would leave a `pending` row that nothing ever dispatches again. The token condition stops a worker that was slow rather than crashed: once its lease has expired and another worker has claimed the delivery, its late write matches no row instead of overwriting the new claimant's result, for instance turning a `delivered` row back into a retry.

A crash after the send but before the record leaves the lease to expire and another worker to retry, so the endpoint can receive one delivery twice with the same `delivery_id`. After a timeout the platform cannot know whether the endpoint processed the request, so only the receiver can make processing exactly-once: it treats POSTs with the same `delivery_id` as one and remembers ids for at least the 80-minute retry horizon, a requirement written into the tenant documentation.

Response codes, in order: `2xx` is success, terminal. `410 Gone` dead-letters the delivery and pauses the endpoint (it is not deleted), notifying the tenant. `408`, `429`, `5xx`, connection and DNS failures, and a timed-out request retry, since each can clear up by itself. A `Retry-After` on a `429` or `503` becomes a floor under the backoff, unless it would push the next attempt past the 80-minute horizon, in which case the delivery is dead-lettered. Every other `4xx` (`400`, `404`, `422`, `401`/`403`) and any `3xx` do not retry: the same payload against the same unchanged handler gets the same answer, and a tenant who fixes it can call replay. Redirects are not followed, for the SSRF reason in deep dive (c).

**Retry policy and fault isolation.** Retries use exponential backoff: 30 s, 90 s, 270 s, 810 s, capped at 30 minutes, for up to 7 attempts. Jitter only shortens a gap (each is drawn between half and all of it), so the six gaps plus seven 10 s requests take at most 81 minutes, inside the 90-minute target; a delivery still failing then becomes `dead` and sits in the tenant's dead-letter list until replayed.

Since slow and dead endpoints hold 71% of in-flight requests with 10% of traffic, a batch of bad endpoints left unchecked could exhaust the pool for everyone. A dedicated queue per endpoint would isolate them perfectly, but running and rebalancing 300,000 partitions is an operational cost that scales with endpoint count, not load; sharing one pool while bounding what each endpoint can take gets the same isolation without it. Two mechanisms, both kept per endpoint in the shared slot store:

- **A per-endpoint concurrency cap.** At most $K = 5$ requests in flight per endpoint. Each slot is an entry keyed by the attempt's `lease_token` that expires with the lease, so a crashed worker's slot frees itself; a plain counter, incremented on claim and decremented on outcome, would leak a slot per crash until the endpoint was blocked for good. The count is soft state, so an in-memory store will do: losing it loosens the cap for one lease period. A worker that finds the endpoint at $K$ does not wait; it moves the row's `next_retry_at` a few seconds out without spending an attempt. One dead endpoint then holds at most 5 of the 16,200 slots however deep its backlog, and even 300 endpoints failing together (0.1% of them — a shared hosting provider going down) hold at most $300 \times 5 = 1{,}500$, 9.3%; uncapped, a dead endpoint holds its own $\lambda \times 10$ s of slots, growing with its traffic and retries. The cost is a ceiling of $K/W$ per endpoint, 25 deliveries/sec at 200 ms: over 300 times the peak average of 0.075/sec, but an endpoint that needs more must be given a larger $K$. - **A circuit breaker** on a rolling window of the endpoint's last 20 real attempts: 16 or more failures trip it. While it is tripped, deliveries to the endpoint fail at once — counted as an attempt and rescheduled on the normal backoff, with no call and no slot — for a cooldown (2 minutes, doubling on repeated trips, capped at 30 minutes); then one probe request goes through, whose success closes the breaker and whose failure re-trips it. An endpoint busy enough to fill its 5 slots with 10 s timeouts trips after about $16 \times 10 / 5 = 32$ s, and from then on holds one probe per cooldown instead of 5 slots for the whole 80-minute horizon.

An endpoint whose breaker stays tripped through 10 consecutive dead-lettered deliveries in an hour is set to `disabled_after_failures` and the tenant notified; re-enabling it takes a deliberate `PATCH`.

**Ordering and security.** With $K = 5$ there is no ordering guarantee: up to five deliveries to one endpoint are in flight together, and a retry of an earlier event can land after a later event that succeeded on its first try. So every body carries `delivery_id`, `event_id`, `created_at` and the event's per-tenant `sequence`: a receiver that cares keeps, per object, the highest `sequence` it has applied and discards older updates, or treats the webhook as a cue to fetch the current state. Strict order is opt-in per endpoint: $K = 1$, the next delivery in `sequence` order not attempted until the previous one is `delivered` or `dead`, and that tenant's fan-out run in `sequence` order. The cost is head-of-line blocking: every later event waits behind one that is retrying, for up to 80 minutes, and the endpoint's ceiling drops from $K/W$ to $1/W$ — harmless at an average endpoint's 0.025/sec, but one failing event stalls the whole stream.

Each attempt is signed with the endpoint's current secret over `"{timestamp}.{raw_body}"` (HMAC-SHA256) and sent as `t=<unix_ts>,v1=<hex_hmac>`. `t` is the time of that attempt, so a retry an hour later still passes the receiver's check, and `delivery_id` sits inside the signed body. The receiver recomputes the HMAC over the raw bytes, compares it in constant time, and rejects any `t` more than 5 minutes from its own clock; that bounds how long a captured request stays replayable, and within the window its `delivery_id` check absorbs a replay. Rotating a secret (`rotate_secret`) keeps the old one valid for 24 hours, during which every request also carries a `v0` signature made with it, so a receiver mid-migration validates against whichever secret it has configured.

A callback URL is resolved and checked at registration: it must be `https`, and none of its resolved addresses (IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms included) may fall in a private, loopback, link-local or other reserved range; link-local covers the cloud metadata address `169.254.169.254`. That alone is not enough, since DNS can change afterward (DNS rebinding): a name that resolved to a public address at registration can point at an internal one by the next delivery. So every send repeats the resolve-and-check and connects directly to the address it just checked, using the hostname only for SNI, certificate verification and the `Host` header; no second, unchecked resolution happens between the check and the connection. Redirects are not followed: the `Location` target was never resolved or checked, so following it would walk straight past the check.

### Follow-ups

- A per-tenant concurrency ceiling, not just a per-endpoint one, would be needed once a single tenant's many endpoints could together still crowd out other tenants sharing the pool.
- Replay is bounded by the 14-day event retention, not the 30-day record retention: an older dead-lettered delivery keeps its history row but cannot be replayed, since its event is gone.

The first block checks the estimates. The second models deep dives (a) and (b) step by step: the two orderings of ingestion, then an exhaustive search over the fan-out worker, the scheduler's two scans, lease expiry, the per-endpoint slots (with $K = 1$) and the workers' claim, send and fenced record, with up to two worker deaths. It runs two configurations: two endpoints, one worker and one attempt each; and one endpoint with two workers and two attempts, where a slow worker can outlive its lease. It checks that no `delivered` or `dead` row is ever rewritten, that nothing is dead-lettered early or recorded by an older attempt, and that every reachable state can still finish with each row terminal and no slot held. Each broken variant is caught: without the `lease_token` condition a slow worker's late write rewrites a `delivered` row; a retry scheduled by a second write can be stranded; setting `fanned_out_at` first loses a delivery row; a slot without expiry leaks and blocks the endpoint.
