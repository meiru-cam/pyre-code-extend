Worth confirming before designing: in a channel of tens of thousands, whether a device not showing the channel needs each message within 700 ms or only an unread indicator, and whether offline members are pushed every post or only @-mentions. Below, the indicator and mentions only.

### Requirements and scale

**Message rate.** $210\times10^6$ messages/day average to

$$\text{avg QPS} = \frac{210\times10^6}{86{,}400} \approx 2{,}431 \text{ messages/s.}$$

Usage concentrates in business hours, only partly spread out by time zones; a 5x peak-to-average ratio puts the peak write rate at about $12{,}153$ messages/s.

**Connections and gateways.** At peak, 15% of the $6\times10^6$ daily actives are connected at once ($900{,}000$), each with 1.3 devices, for $900{,}000\times1.3=1{,}170{,}000$ concurrent WebSocket connections. Budgeting 15,000 connections per gateway instance (bounded by per-connection buffers and local fan-out cost, not raw memory) needs $\lceil 1{,}170{,}000/15{,}000\rceil=78$ instances bare; 15% headroom for rolling deploys and failure brings the fleet to $90$.

**Average-channel fan-out.** A channel someone is actively posting into averages 18 members; assuming the same 15% concurrency fraction holds within its membership, about $18\times0.15=2.7$ members are online at a time, each with 1.3 devices, for $2.7\times1.3\approx3.51$ socket deliveries per message. Taking large channels (threshold set below) as 8% of daily message volume, the other 92% — $11{,}181$ messages/s at peak — pushes at $11{,}181\times3.51\approx39{,}244$ deliveries/s system-wide.

**Large-channel fan-out.** A 40,000-member channel, at the same 15% concurrency and 1.3 devices/member, has $40{,}000\times0.15=6{,}000$ members online — $6{,}000\times1.3=7{,}800$ deliveries for one message if pushed the ordinary way. Posting 5 messages/s in its busiest minute, it would alone generate $39{,}000$ deliveries/s, about as many as all small channels combined — so large channels get their own mode.

**Storage.** A message row (`message_id`, `channel_id`, `seq`, `sender_id`, average 100-byte text, attachment references, idempotency key) is about 180 bytes: $210\times10^6\times180\text{ B}\approx37.8$ GB/day, $\approx13.8$ TB/year before replication, $\approx41.4$ TB/year at 3x replication.

### Data model and API

**Message** — `message_id` (globally unique), `channel_id`, `workspace_id`, `seq` (per-channel position), `type` (`post` or `delete`), `sender_id`, `text` (null on a `delete` row and on a deleted post), `attachments` (`[{file_id, name, size, content_type}]`), `target_seq` (only on `delete`: the `seq` of the post it removes), `client_msg_id` (idempotency key, unique with `channel_id` and `sender_id`), `created_at`.

**Channel** — `channel_id`, `workspace_id`, `kind` (`dm` or `channel`; a DM is a two-member channel), `member_count` (picks the delivery mode), `latest_seq` (the last `seq` assigned), `name`. The row lives on the same message-store shard as the channel's messages.

**ChannelMember** — `channel_id`, `user_id`, `workspace_id` (denormalized so every membership read is also an isolation check), `joined_at`, `muted`.

**ReadCursor** — `user_id`, `channel_id`, `last_read_seq`, `updated_at`: one row per (user, channel), not per message or per device; every device shows the channel as unread while `latest_seq` is past it.

**Connection** — `connection_id` (one per socket), `user_id`, `device_id`, `gateway_id`, `connected_at`: written only on connect and disconnect. Each gateway also keeps one liveness record with a TTL.

Core APIs:

- `POST /channels/{channel_id}/messages` — `{client_msg_id, text, attachments}`. Appends a `post` row, assigning it the channel's next `seq`; a request whose `client_msg_id` was already recorded returns the original result. Returns `{message_id, seq, created_at}`.
- `GET /channels/{channel_id}/messages?after_seq=&limit=` — history and gap-fill, in `seq` order; used for initial load, opening a large channel, and reconnect backfill.
- `DELETE /channels/{channel_id}/messages/{message_id}` — only the sender may call this. Appends a `delete` row, assigning it the channel's next `seq` with `target_seq` set to the removed post's `seq`; deleting an already deleted post returns the first result. Returns `{seq, deleted_at}`.
- `POST /channels/{channel_id}/read` — `{last_read_seq}`. Upserts the caller's `ReadCursor` row.
- `GET /me/channels` — every channel the caller belongs to, with `{channel_id, last_read_seq, latest_seq}`; used on startup and on reconnect.

WebSocket, server → client: `message.new {channel_id, seq, message_id, sender_id, text, created_at}`; `message.deleted {channel_id, seq, target_seq}`; `channel.activity {channel_id, latest_seq}` (large channels: a pointer, not the body); `read.updated {channel_id, last_read_seq}` (to a user's other devices). Client → server: `channel.focus {channel_id}` (the channel now on screen).

```

The send endpoint checks membership with the channel service, then writes the message durably to the message store, assigning `seq` in the same transaction; the sender's response waits on this write. After the commit the API server finds, in the routing table, the gateways holding a socket of an online member and publishes once to each over the best-effort bus; each gateway forwards the message to its matching local sockets. The store's write stream separately feeds the notification service, off the sender's path. Attachments go from the client straight to the file store under a `workspace_id`-prefixed key, and only a reference travels with the message; a download gets a short-lived signed URL only after the API checks that the caller belongs to the message's channel and the message is not deleted.

### Deep dives

**Message delivery and fan-out.** Pushing a message the instant it is written (fan-out-on-write) is what the 700 ms target needs; leaving it for clients to pull (fan-out-on-read) costs nothing until a client asks, but a client that does not ask never sees it. Push is not free: one post costs the send path one routing lookup per member and the gateways one frame per online device, so a channel of $N$ members posting $r$ messages/s costs $N r$ lookups/s and $0.15\times1.3\times N r=0.195 N r$ frames/s. Capacity is planned for the smooth sum of many small channels; one channel's load arrives at once and can jump with a single incident, so no one channel may add more than 5% to the peak push volume, $0.05\times39{,}244\approx1{,}962$ frames/s. At a busiest-minute rate of 5 messages/s that allows $N\le1{,}962/(0.195\times5)\approx2{,}012$ (the lookups give the same bound), so the threshold is a round **2,000 members**. Below it, the API publishes to each gateway holding an online member's socket (every gateway subscribes to its own bus topic), and each fans out locally.

At or above it, nothing is routed per member. Each gateway subscribes to the topic of every large channel one of its connected users belongs to (from the user's channel list at connect, updated on join and leave), and a post is published once to that topic. Per-member routing would not narrow this anyway: with 300 of 2,000 members online, a given gateway holds none of them with probability $(1-1/90)^{300}\approx3.5\%$. The gateway pushes the full message only to sockets that have the channel on screen (from `channel.focus`); every other member socket gets a `channel.activity {channel_id, latest_seq}` pointer at most once per 2 s, since a newer pointer supersedes an older one — a message body cannot be merged that way. A client opening the channel pulls with `after_seq`. For the 40,000-member channel at 5 messages/s, its 7,800 online devices get at most $7{,}800/2=3{,}900$ pointers/s, plus one frame per message for each device viewing it, instead of $39{,}000$ messages/s.

The bus only carries a live copy to sockets connected *right now* — durability comes from the store write and replay from `after_seq` — so a best-effort in-memory pub/sub fits, not a persistent partitioned log with retention and consumer offsets. Broadcasting each small-channel post to all $90$ gateways would send about 26 times the copies needed: its 3.51 sockets sit on about 3.5 gateways.

A gateway writes a `Connection` row on connect and deletes it on disconnect. No lease is needed: a socket belongs to one process, a gateway writes only its own rows, and a duplicate copy is harmless because a client applies events by `(channel_id, seq)` and drops repeats. What needs care is stale rows. Rows are keyed by `connection_id`, so when a device reconnects before its old socket times out, the old gateway's late delete removes only the old row; keyed by `(user_id, device_id)`, it would erase the new registration and the device would silently stop receiving pushes. Each gateway refreshes its liveness record every 3 s with a 10 s TTL, and `gateway_id` names one process lifetime; readers skip rows of a lapsed gateway, and a sweeper deletes them. A gateway that loses contact with the routing store or the bus closes its client sockets, so those clients reconnect elsewhere (with jittered backoff) instead of sitting on a socket that receives nothing, and gap-fill recovers what they missed.

Off the sender's path, the notification service queues a push for every member with no connected device and every @-mentioned member, skipping those who muted the channel or are inside their do-not-disturb schedule (a per-user setting); in channels of 2,000 or more only mentions push, so no post walks a 40,000-member list.

**Ordering, deduplication and reconnection.** Every message and delete needs a per-channel `seq` that is never assigned twice and has no holes, so that a hole on the client means a missed message. Either a dedicated process per channel (or shard) hands out numbers from memory — fast, but a stateful owner that needs a lease and fencing to survive failover — or the store increments the channel's row inside the insert's transaction (`UPDATE channels SET latest_seq = latest_seq + 1 WHERE channel_id = $1 RETURNING latest_seq`). The Channel row shares the `channel_id` shard key with the messages, so the second is a single-shard transaction, and this design uses it. The row lock is held from the increment until commit, replication round trip included — take 5 ms — so one channel accepts at most about 200 posts/s; a channel at 50 posts/s, ten times the busy rate above, uses a quarter of that and waits under a millisecond for the lock on average. There are no holes: a rolled-back transaction rolls back its increment too, and the next post cannot take the lock until the previous one commits, so `seq` values become visible in order. A hole a client sees is therefore a message still in flight or missed — two publishes can arrive out of order — and an `after_seq` fetch fills it.

A delete appends a `delete` row with its own fresh `seq` and a `target_seq`, and in the same transaction clears the original row's text and attachment references, so history stops serving them. The new row is what reconnect relies on: a client that already saw the post has a `last_seen_seq` past it, so a `seq > last_seen_seq` gap-fill would miss a change made only to the old row, but it finds the delete and the client tombstones its copy. A background job then removes the file objects; a download URL signed before the delete works until it expires (5 minutes).

`client_msg_id` is unique together with `(channel_id, sender_id)`. A retried send whose insert hits that constraint rolls back, increment included, so it consumes no second `seq`, and returns the existing row: the client sees the same `{message_id, seq}` whichever attempt landed.

A client tracks the last `seq` it applied in each channel it has opened. Once its new socket is registered, it calls `GET /me/channels` and backfills with `after_seq` only the channels whose `latest_seq` is ahead; anything committed after that snapshot is pushed to the new socket, and pushes overlapping the backfill are dropped by `seq`. For a user in 300 channels the response is about $300\times50\text{ B}\approx15$ KB, and the server reads the 300 `latest_seq` values with one batched query per message-store shard involved, not one per channel.

Marking a channel read writes one `ReadCursor` row and pushes `read.updated` to the user's *other* connected devices (routing table, looked up by `user_id`), so every open screen clears the badge together.

**Multi-tenancy and sharding.** The message store shards by `channel_id`, not `workspace_id`: sharding by workspace would put one very active company's channels on a single shard, a hot shard exactly where load is heaviest, while `channel_id` spreads even one workspace across many shards. `workspace_id` is still on every row of every table, as an authorization filter on every read, and is `ChannelMember`'s own shard key, since "list my channels" is workspace-scoped and small.

Every request authenticates with a token scoped to one `workspace_id`, checked against the request's target. A per-workspace token bucket sized from the seat count bounds what a runaway bot can draw from shared shards without throttling a normal peak: with 30% of registered users active daily, a 50,000-seat workspace expects $50{,}000\times0.3\times35\times5/86{,}400\approx30$ messages/s at peak, so its bucket refills at three times that, 90/s. Message text and files are encrypted at rest with a key selected by `workspace_id`, so reading one tenant's data out of stolen storage also takes that tenant's key.

### Follow-ups

- Editing could reuse the delete mechanism: an `edit` row with a fresh `seq` and a `target_seq`, rewriting the original row's text in the same transaction, which gap-fill finds like a delete.
- A channel posting faster than one row lock allows (about 200 posts/s) would need its counter split, giving up the single per-channel order used here.
