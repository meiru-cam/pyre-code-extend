Confirm two things with your recruiter before you prepare: how the 60 minutes splits between your presentation and questions, and whether you should share your screen or send the deck ahead of time. The project doesn't need to involve AI at all — this round is judged on your decisions and trade-offs, not on the technology.

### Slide outline

Eight slides is a reasonable target. Much more than that and the deck does not fit the time, and the interviewer starts interrupting before you reach the results. The throughline is motivation and constraints, then the solution and its trade-offs, then the result in metrics, then the lessons — in that order, so each later slide answers a question the earlier ones raised.

- **Slide 1: title and one-line summary** — what the system does, who used it, over what period. Not: your background or the team's org chart.
- **Slide 2: motivation and constraints** — the problem before the project existed, and the constraints that actually shaped the design (a deadline, team size, a system you had to integrate with, a budget). Not: a full requirements document.
- **Slide 3: architecture** — a diagram of the main components and how one request or one piece of data flows through them. Not: every internal service, only what the rest of the talk refers back to.
- **Slides 4–5: two key decisions, one slide each** — the alternative you did not take and the constraint that ruled it out (one row of the comparison table in the next section). Not: a bullet list of technology names with no reasoning attached.
- **Slide 6: results** — the metric, the before/after numbers, what they were measured against. Not: a number you cannot explain how you computed.
- **Slide 7: what you would change** — the biggest mistake, and what breaks first at 10x. Not: a vague "add more monitoring".
- **Slide 8: backup** — a fuller architecture diagram, secondary metrics, a third decision you did not have room for on slides 4–5. Shown only if asked.

A workable split for the hour is a short presentation, on the order of 15–20 minutes, leaving most of the round for questions; use the split your recruiter confirms rather than assuming one.

### Architecture and key decisions

This tests whether you actually made the decision, or the "decision" was really the only option you looked at.

For "what problem were you solving and what counted as success", state the problem itself first — who had it, how bad it was — then give the success bar you set before you started building: a specific number or a pass/fail line, not one you reverse-engineered from the result afterward.

Skeleton for each decision: state the decision, the constraint that drove it, the alternative(s) you considered, why you ruled them out, which of accuracy, latency, cost, scalability, reliability, complexity or iteration speed it traded against which, and the condition under which you would choose differently today. Prepare this as a table, one row per alternative, for every decision you expect to be asked about. A fictional example, for a batch pipeline that merges small files and loads them into a warehouse once an hour:

- Alternative: Stream each record through a queue instead of batching hourly · Why not, at the time: The upstream system only produced hourly snapshots, so minute-level latency bought nothing and added operational surface · Under what condition you'd switch: The upstream moved to change-data-capture and a downstream consumer needed minute-level freshness
- Alternative: A managed ETL product instead of the team's own scheduler · Why not, at the time: The team already ran everything else on that scheduler; a second tool costs more in operational overhead than it saves · Under what condition you'd switch: This pipeline's complexity grew past what the existing scheduler can express

The most common way to lose points here is naming the choice without the alternatives — "we used X" instead of "we considered X, Y, Z and ruled out Y and Z because...". Prepare the table before the round, not during it.

A second common failure: the interviewer proposes an alternative that does not actually apply to your problem, and you answer as if it does. Before defending against it, restate the constraint or input the alternative assumes and check it against your actual problem. If that constraint does not hold in your case, say so and explain what would have to change for the alternative to make sense, rather than forcing a defense of a comparison that does not fit.

### Scale and limits

This tests whether you can reason about the real bottleneck quantitatively, not recite "add more servers" or "add caching".

Skeleton: name the resource that is the current bottleneck, say what breaks first at 10x, name the concrete change (sharding, an added cache, batching, a different data structure), and say where that change itself hits a new limit.

The common failure is a generic answer — "we'd scale horizontally" — with no resource named and no order-of-magnitude numbers from the actual system. Memorize two or three real numbers from your project (current throughput, current data size, the actual bottleneck you hit) before the round, and be ready to say which of them would move first if the others stayed fixed.

### Measuring impact

This tests whether the metric is well defined, whether you can rule out other explanations, and whether you can separate what you did from what the team did.

Skeleton: define the metric and how it was computed, name what it was compared against (a prior baseline, a control group, a rollback), name a plausible confound and why you believe it is not the explanation, then state your own contribution in one sentence, separate from the team's.

The common failure is a metric you cannot explain the computation of, or an attribution that is either all "I" or all "we" — interviewers read both as evasive. Prepare one sentence that names exactly which piece was yours, for example "I designed and built the ranking change; a teammate built the logging that measured it; the rollout plan was a team decision."

### Retrospective

This tests self-awareness: whether you can name a real cost, not a cosmetic one.

Skeleton: one decision you would reverse, the signal that would have told you earlier, and what you did differently on a later project because of it.

The common failure is "nothing, it went well" or naming something trivial as the biggest mistake. Pick a decision that had a real cost — rework, an outage, months of delay — not a stylistic regret.

### Where AI could help

This tests whether you can point at a specific step, not just say "add AI".

Skeleton: name one manual or heuristic step in the pipeline, describe what a model would replace it with, say where the training and evaluation data would come from, and name the failure mode and how you would bound it (a fallback, a confidence threshold, human review).

The common failure is naming the idea without the data — "a model could do this triage" without saying what the inputs, outputs, or labels would be, even at a sketch level — and skipping the failure mode entirely, as if the model would simply always be right.

### Staying within scope

Part of the system was built by other people, and saying so plainly is safer than guessing. Before the round, separate what you built from what you only know as an interface: for a component you did not own, be ready to state its contract — what goes in, what comes out, what it promises — and say directly that you do not know its internals, rather than answering a detail question about it as if you did.

The common failure is guessing at another component's internals well enough to sound plausible, and then getting caught by the one follow-up that needs the actual number. A safer sentence to have ready: "that part belonged to another team; I know it as an interface with this input and this output, and I don't know how it's implemented inside." Naming the boundary costs you nothing — the interviewer is checking whether you know where your own work ends, not whether you can speak to the whole system.
