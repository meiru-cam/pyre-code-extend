Confirm with the interviewer which rule Part 3 means: attack with whoever's `calculate_damage` against the current defender is highest (the rule used below), or attack with whoever is type-advantaged against the defender regardless of the raw number — the two disagree whenever a `1x` attacker's attack stat is high enough to out-damage a `2x` one, e.g. attack `10` at `1x` (damage `10`) against attack `3` at `2x` (damage `6`): the highest-damage rule below picks the first, the type-advantage rule the second.

Write `Monster` and `Team` first, then turn "who attacks" and "what the log line says about the hit" into two swappable hooks with the simplest possible default; Part 2 only has to supply a new hit description, and Part 3 only a new attacker choice — `run_battle` itself never needs to change again.

### Part 1

`choose_attacker` picks the attacker and gets the current defender as an argument even though Part 1's default ignores it; that is what lets Part 3 plug in a defender-aware strategy later without touching `run_battle`. `describe_hit` similarly starts as a no-op so the log has no multiplier tag yet.

```python
class Monster:
    def __init__(self, name, hp, attack):
        self.name = name
        self.hp = hp
        self.attack = attack

    def is_alive(self):
        return self.hp > 0

    def take_damage(self, damage):
        self.hp -= damage

    def calculate_damage(self, defender):
        return self.attack


class Team:
    def __init__(self, name, monsters):
        self.name = name
        self.monsters = monsters

    def first_alive(self):
        return next((m for m in self.monsters if m.is_alive()), None)

    def is_defeated(self):
        return self.first_alive() is None


def default_choose_attacker(attacking_team, defender):
    return attacking_team.first_alive()      # NOTE: `defender` is unused here, only in Part 3's strategy


def default_describe_hit(attacker, defender):
    return ""


def run_battle(team_a, team_b, choose_attacker=default_choose_attacker, describe_hit=default_describe_hit):
    log = [f"Match start: {team_a.name} takes on {team_b.name}"]
    attacking, defending = team_a, team_b
    while attacking.first_alive() is not None and defending.first_alive() is not None:
        defender = defending.first_alive()
        attacker = choose_attacker(attacking, defender)
        damage = attacker.calculate_damage(defender)
        tag = describe_hit(attacker, defender)
        defender.take_damage(damage)              # NOTE: apply damage before reading is_alive()/hp below
        if defender.is_alive():
            log.append(f"{attacker.name} hits {defender.name} for {damage} damage{tag}. "
                        f"{defender.name} has {defender.hp} HP left.")
        else:
            log.append(f"{attacker.name} hits {defender.name} for {damage} damage{tag}. "
                        f"{defender.name} is defeated!")
        attacking, defending = defending, attacking
    winner = team_a if team_a.first_alive() is not None else team_b
    log.append(f"Match over: {winner.name} wins!")
    return log
```

### Part 2

The four elements form a single cycle of advantage, so the table only needs the four "strong against" entries plus their four reverses; a pair that is not in `TYPE_CHART` (same element, or the two elements that are neither strong nor weak against each other) defaults to `1.0`. `Monster.__init__` and `calculate_damage` are attached to the `Monster` class of Part 1 instead of rewriting `is_alive` and `take_damage`.

```python
from enum import Enum
import math


class ElementType(Enum):
    EMBER = "Ember"
    TIDE = "Tide"
    BRAMBLE = "Bramble"
    SPARK = "Spark"


TYPE_CHART = {
    (ElementType.EMBER, ElementType.BRAMBLE): 2.0,
    (ElementType.BRAMBLE, ElementType.EMBER): 0.5,
    (ElementType.BRAMBLE, ElementType.TIDE): 2.0,
    (ElementType.TIDE, ElementType.BRAMBLE): 0.5,
    (ElementType.TIDE, ElementType.SPARK): 2.0,
    (ElementType.SPARK, ElementType.TIDE): 0.5,
    (ElementType.SPARK, ElementType.EMBER): 2.0,
    (ElementType.EMBER, ElementType.SPARK): 0.5,
}


def type_multiplier(attacker_element, defender_element):
    return TYPE_CHART.get((attacker_element, defender_element), 1.0)


def format_multiplier(multiplier):
    return f"{int(multiplier)}x" if multiplier == int(multiplier) else f"{multiplier}x"


def type_effect_tag(attacker, defender):
    return f" ({format_multiplier(type_multiplier(attacker.element, defender.element))})"


def _init_with_element(self, name, hp, attack, element):
    self.name = name
    self.hp = hp
    self.attack = attack
    self.element = element


def calculate_damage_by_type(self, defender):
    multiplier = type_multiplier(self.element, defender.element)
    return max(1, math.floor(self.attack * multiplier))   # NOTE: floor(1 * 0.5) is 0; the rules say a hit
                                                            #       always deals at least 1


Monster.__init__ = _init_with_element          # attach to the Monster class of Part 1
Monster.calculate_damage = calculate_damage_by_type
```

Calling `run_battle(wildfire, thicket, describe_hit=type_effect_tag)` reproduces the Part 2 example.

### Part 3

`best_attacker_against` is attached to the `Team` class of Part 1. Python's `max` returns the first element that reaches the maximum key when several tie, which is exactly the required tie-break.

```python
def best_attacker_against(self, defender):
    living = [m for m in self.monsters if m.is_alive()]
    # NOTE: max() keeps the FIRST element on a tie (checked: max(['a', 'b'], key={'a': 5, 'b': 5}.get) == 'a')
    return max(living, key=lambda m: m.calculate_damage(defender), default=None)


Team.best_attacker_against = best_attacker_against   # attach to the Team class of Part 1


def smart_choose_attacker(attacking_team, defender):
    return attacking_team.best_attacker_against(defender)
```

Calling `run_battle(skyfleet, depths, choose_attacker=smart_choose_attacker, describe_hit=type_effect_tag)` reproduces the Part 3 example; `run_battle` is exactly the function from Part 1, unmodified.

### Follow-ups

- A `speed` field that decides who acts first each round would be a third hook (which side goes next), independent of the damage and targeting hooks above; the turn loop would not otherwise change.
- Area attacks or status effects (poison, stun) need a phase that resolves existing effects before the usual attack, the same before-then-act structure a day-by-day grid simulation uses.
- With many more elements, most pairs stay neutral, so keeping only the exceptions in a dict remains cheap; if the lookup ever becomes the hot loop, a small integer code per element and a 2D table is several times faster than the `Enum`-keyed dict, whose cost is hashing a tuple of two `Enum` members, not its size.
- Greedy targeting is minimax-optimal under these rules, not just a heuristic — for the win and for the winner's remaining HP: the choice of attacker changes nothing but how much HP the current defender loses, and a position in which the opponent has pointwise less HP is never worse for you (induction over the game tree, since the defender is forced and the attacker takes no damage). It stops being optimal as soon as the attacking team may also choose its target: a lone `Tide` monster (hp 7, attack 2) facing `Bramble` (hp 1, attack 6) then `Ember` (hp 2, attack 3) loses if it takes the bigger 2-damage hit on `Ember`, and wins if it spends a 1-damage hit on `Bramble` first.
- Once a mechanic adds randomness (crits, miss chance), exact log comparison stops working; fix the seed so a run is reproducible, and check invariants instead — combined HP never increases, and the battle still terminates.
