Worth confirming before coding: whether a `Snapshot` query about an id it does not know should raise or be treated as "no relationship" (taken here to raise, matching `follow()`); and whether the Part 4 event stream is really guaranteed non-decreasing in `t`, since that assumption is what keeps every per-pair event list sorted for free.

### Part 1

Both classes store adjacency as `dict[str, set[str]]`. A `set` makes `follow` and duplicate-follow detection O(1) for free (`set.add` on an existing element is a no-op), so the only rule that needs an explicit check is self-follow. The one real trap is `create_snapshot`: copying the *outer* dict is not enough, because the *inner* sets would still be the same objects the live `SocialNetwork` keeps mutating.

```python
class SocialNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        self._users = set()
        self._following = {}

    def add_user(self, user_id):
        if user_id in self._users:
            raise ValueError(f"user already exists: {user_id!r}")
        self._users.add(user_id)
        self._following[user_id] = set()

    def follow(self, follower, followee):
        if follower not in self._users or followee not in self._users:
            raise ValueError("unknown user")
        if follower == followee:          # NOTE: checked before any mutation, so self-follow is a no-op
            return
        self._following[follower].add(followee)   # NOTE: set.add is idempotent -> duplicate follow is a no-op too

    def create_snapshot(self):
        return Snapshot(self._users, self._following)


class Snapshot:
    def __init__(self, users, following):
        self._users = set(users)
        # NOTE: copy EACH inner set. following.copy() alone would copy the outer dict but keep the
        # same inner set objects, so a later SocialNetwork.follow() would still mutate this snapshot.
        self._following = {u: set(fs) for u, fs in following.items()}
        self._followers = {u: set() for u in self._users}   # reverse index, used starting get_followers below
        for u, followees in self._following.items():
            for v in followees:
                self._followers[v].add(u)

    def _check(self, user_id):
        if user_id not in self._users:
            raise ValueError(f"unknown user: {user_id!r}")

    def is_following(self, follower, followee):
        self._check(follower)
        self._check(followee)
        return followee in self._following[follower]
```

### Part 2

`get_following` just sorts the stored set. `get_followers` could instead scan every user's followee set at call time, but that costs O(users + edges) per call no matter how small the answer is; building the reverse index once, during the O(users + edges) construction pass above, makes both methods cost only as much as the size of their own answer.

```python
def get_following(self, user_id):
    self._check(user_id)
    return sorted(self._following[user_id])          # NOTE: sets have no reliable order; sort for determinism


def get_followers(self, user_id):
    self._check(user_id)
    return sorted(self._followers[user_id])


Snapshot.get_following = get_following      # attach both methods to the Snapshot class of Part 1
Snapshot.get_followers = get_followers
```

### Part 3

For each followee `f` of `user_id`, every one of `f`'s own followees `c` gets one point, tallied in a `Counter`; a candidate's final score is exactly the number of distinct `f` through which it is reached, since `_following[f]` is a set and so contributes at most once per `f`. Sorting by `(-score, user_id)` gives score descending with an alphabetical tie-break in a single pass, and slicing `[:k]` handles `k` larger than the candidate count for free.

```python
from collections import Counter


def recommend(self, user_id, k):
    self._check(user_id)
    direct = self._following[user_id]
    counts = Counter()
    for f in direct:
        for c in self._following[f]:
            if c != user_id and c not in direct:   # NOTE: exclude the user itself and already-followed accounts
                counts[c] += 1
    ranked = sorted(counts, key=lambda c: (-counts[c], c))   # NOTE: ties broken by user id ascending
    return ranked[:k]           # NOTE: k > len(ranked) just returns every candidate, no error or padding


Snapshot.recommend = recommend              # attach to the Snapshot class of Part 1
```

Let $n$ be the number of users and $m$ the number of follow edges at snapshot time, $d(u)$ the number of accounts $u$ follows and $d^-(u)$ the number that follow $u$. For `recommend`, let $F = d(\text{user\_id})$ and $C$ be the number of distinct candidates found; the inner double loop visits $\sum_{f} d(f) = O(F \cdot G)$ pairs, where $G$ is the average out-degree among `user_id`'s own followees.

- Method: `add_user`, `follow` · Time: O(1) · Space: O(1)
- Method: `create_snapshot` · Time: O(n + m) · Space: O(n + m)
- Method: `is_following` · Time: O(1) · Space: O(1)
- Method: `get_following(u)` · Time: $O(d(u) \log d(u))$ · Space: $O(d(u))$
- Method: `get_followers(u)` · Time: $O(d^-(u) \log d^-(u))$ · Space: $O(d^-(u))$
- Method: `recommend(u, k)` · Time: $O(F \cdot G + C \log C)$ · Space: $O(C)$

### Part 4

Store, per `(follower, followee)` pair, only the timestamps at which its state toggled, in the order the calls happened. Because the global call stream is non-decreasing in `t`, each pair's own list is appended to in increasing order and is therefore already sorted — no separate sort step is needed. The list always alternates start, stop, start, stop, ... beginning with a start, because `unfollow` is a no-op whenever the pair is not currently following and `follow` is a no-op whenever it already is; so `is_following(follower, followee, t)` only needs the *count* of events at or before `t`: an odd count means the most recent one was a start.

```python
import bisect


class FollowTimeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self._events = {}  # (follower, followee) -> toggle timestamps, always sorted by construction

    def _following_at(self, key, t):
        events = self._events.get(key)
        if not events:
            return False
        # NOTE: binary search over this one pair's own event list; the alternative -- keeping a
        # full graph snapshot for every past instant and deep-copying one on each event -- would
        # cost O(n + m) per event instead of the O(1) amortized appends follow()/unfollow() do
        i = bisect.bisect_right(events, t)   # NOTE: bisect_right, so a stop/start AT t is already in effect
        return i % 2 == 1                    # NOTE: relies on the log alternating start/stop, first event a start

    def follow(self, follower, followee, t):
        if follower == followee:
            return
        key = (follower, followee)
        if self._following_at(key, t):       # already following -> duplicate call, no-op
            return
        self._events.setdefault(key, []).append(t)

    def unfollow(self, follower, followee, t):
        if follower == followee:
            return
        key = (follower, followee)
        if not self._following_at(key, t):   # not following -> duplicate call, no-op
            return
        self._events[key].append(t)

    def is_following(self, follower, followee, t):
        return self._following_at((follower, followee), t)
```

Using `bisect_right` rather than `bisect_left` is what makes an event at exactly `t` already count — equivalent to storing each `[start, stop)` interval and testing whether `t` falls inside one of them. `follow`/`unfollow` are O(1) amortized (one list append); `is_following` is $O(\log e)$, where $e$ is the number of toggle events recorded so far for that one pair, against $O(1)$ amortized appends for the writes. A naive alternative — replaying the entire call log from the start on every query — costs O(total calls so far) per query instead.

### Follow-ups

- Deep-copying every followee set on every `create_snapshot()` call is wasteful once graphs are large and snapshots are frequent. A copy-on-write representation, where a `follow()` after a snapshot replaces only the one followee set it touches instead of the ones still shared with earlier snapshots, turns `create_snapshot()` into O(1) without any of them observing later writes.
- Storing only the delta between consecutive snapshots, or storing every edge with its own `[start, end)` validity interval, avoids paying for a full graph copy on every snapshot and lets any historical instant be reconstructed by filtering.
- Many `Snapshot` reads can run in parallel, since they only read frozen state; a read-write lock (or the copy-on-write scheme above, which needs no lock for readers at all) serializes `follow()` writes against them without blocking the reads.
- `recommend` could weight each intermediary by how recently `user_id` interacted with them instead of counting every one equally, or repeat the same counting step one level further out for 3-hop suggestions.
- The four parts can also be asked as two separate problems: one that stops at snapshots and history queries (Parts 1, 2, and 4), and a second, differently-framed one that wraps the same snapshot API as a versioned key-value store (`SET`/`GET` by version number instead of `follow`/`is_following`).
