Two points worth confirming before designing: whether anonymous (unauthenticated) creation needs to be supported at all, or every caller already carries an owner id from an existing auth layer; and whether a single shared domain is enough for now, with branded per-owner domains left for later. The design below assumes anonymous creation is allowed, just never deduplicated, and a single shared domain.

### Requirements and scale

**Short-code length.** Planning for $Y=5$ years at $r = 1{,}200{,}000$ creates/day gives a total volume of

$$n = r \cdot 365 \cdot Y = 2.19\times10^{9} \text{ codes.}$$

A base62 alphabet (62 symbols) of length $k$ names $N=62^k$ distinct codes. The scheme chosen in the short-code generation deep dive draws a code at random and retries on collision. When $i$ codes are already taken, a draw collides with probability $i/N$, so that insert needs $i/(N-i)$ retries on average, and filling the space to $n$ needs

$$R = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{i}{N-i} \approx \frac{n^2}{2N} \quad (n \ll N)$$

retries in expectation. This is an expected count, not the birthday-paradox probability of at least one collision, which at these sizes is essentially 1. At $k=6$ ($N\approx5.68\times10^{10}$, 3.9% full after 5 years) that is $R\approx43.3$ million, where the approximation alone gives 42.2 million; at $k=7$ ($N\approx3.52\times10^{12}$) it is about 681,000. One more character cuts retries by more than 60x, so $k=7$ is what this design uses; after 5 years only $n/N\approx0.062\%$ of the space is taken.

**Storage.** A link record is about 167 bytes: a 7-byte code, a 110-byte average long URL, an 8-byte owner id, three 8-byte timestamps/counters (`created_at`, `expires_at`, `click_count`), a 16-byte URL hash for dedup, and two 1-byte flags; an authenticated link also has a 31-byte dedup row (owner id, URL hash, code). With roughly 1.5x overhead for indexes and log-structured storage, the upper bound of 198 bytes per link becomes 297 bytes on disk, so $n$ links take $n \times 297\text{B} \approx 650$ GB for one copy and $\approx 1.95$ TB with 3x replication; since the store's QPS is small (redirect QPS, cache), capacity is what sets the shard count.

**Redirect QPS.** At the 100:1 ratio, $1.2\times10^{8}$ redirects/day average to $\approx1{,}389$ QPS; the 5x peak factor puts the number the redirect service and cache must be provisioned for at $\approx6{,}944$ QPS. Creates stay under 70 QPS even at peak.

**Cache.** Assume a day's redirects are spread over a pool of $M=5{,}000{,}000$ codes with Zipf popularity of exponent $s=1.1$ (the $j$-th most popular code draws a share proportional to $j^{-s}$). The hottest $C=10^6$ (20% of the pool) then draw $\sum_{j\le C} j^{-s} / \sum_{j\le M} j^{-s} \approx 95.6\%$ of requests, so the cache needs to hold about a million entries. At about 126 bytes each (code, URL, `expires_at`, status) that is 126 MB, while an 8 GiB node holds $\approx68$ million: memory is not the binding constraint, the TTL is (read path). With the 24-hour TTL chosen there the regional hit rate is about 95.3%, so the store absorbs $\approx6{,}944\times(1-0.9526)\approx330$ QPS of misses at peak, alongside the sub-70-QPS creates.

### Data model and API

**Link** — `short_code` (primary key: 7 base62 characters when generated, 3-32 caller-chosen base62 characters for a custom alias, one shared namespace either way, with API path names such as `links` reserved), `long_url`, `url_hash` (16-byte hash of the normalized URL, set only when `owner_id` is present), `owner_id` (nullable), `created_at`, `expires_at` (nullable), `status` (`active | expired | deleted`), `click_count` (updated asynchronously, never on the request path), `is_custom_alias`. An `(owner_id, created_at)` → `short_code` secondary index serves an owner's paginated listing.

**Dedup** — `(owner_id, url_hash)` → `short_code`, a table of its own written only with conditional writes: the link store is sharded by code, so an index over it could not enforce this uniqueness in one place. The hash keeps the key short however long the URL is; at 16 bytes, even if all $n$ links belonged to one owner, the expected number of colliding pairs would be about $7\times10^{-21}$ (a reuse still compares the stored `long_url`). A create writes its link row first and its dedup row second, as an insert-if-absent; if a concurrent create of the same URL got there first, this one returns the winner's code and marks its own fresh row `deleted`, never having handed it out. A dedup row pointing at an expired or deleted link counts as no match and is replaced by a compare-and-set on the old code.

Core APIs:

- `POST /links` — `{long_url, custom_alias?, expires_at?, force_new?}`, `owner_id` from the auth context (absent for an anonymous call). Returns `201 {short_code, short_url, long_url, expires_at, created_at, reused: false}` for a new code; when the owner's dedup row finds a live match (including the one a concurrent create just wrote) and `force_new` was not set, returns `200` with the existing record and `reused: true`; when `custom_alias` is already taken, returns `409 {error: "alias_taken"}` — no retry, no substitute code.
- `GET /{short_code}` — the redirect: `302` to `long_url` when the link is `active` and not past `expires_at` (compared with the clock on every request, so expiry takes effect on time); `404` when the code was never issued; `410 Gone` when it was issued but is deleted or expired, so a caller can tell "never existed" from "existed, then died"; `503` when the regional replica has no row and the shard leader cannot be reached (architecture), since a `404` there might be wrong. Every response carries `Cache-Control: no-store`. `302`, not `301`: without explicit cache headers a `301` is cacheable by default and browsers tend to keep it for a long time, so later clicks never reach this API — the count stops moving and a delete goes unseen. `no-store` would stop that for a `301` too, but a `301` also announces a permanent move, which crawlers credit to the target. `307` and `308` only add a ban on changing the request method, irrelevant for `GET` and `HEAD`; `308` is cacheable by default like `301`.
- `GET /links/{short_code}` — metadata only, no redirect: `{short_code, long_url, click_count, status, created_at, expires_at}`. Used by an owner's dashboard.
- `DELETE /links/{short_code}` — owner-only. Sets `status = deleted`; redirects stop within each region's replication lag (read path), and the code is retired for good.
- `GET /links?cursor=...` — an authenticated owner's own links, newest first, via the `(owner_id, created_at)` index.

### Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph write["Write path"]
        client_w[Client]
        create[Create API]
        dedup[(Dedup table)]
        gen[Code generator]
    end
    subgraph read["Read path, per region"]
        client_r[Client]
        redirect[Redirect service]
        cache[(Regional cache)]
    end
    store[(Link store, sharded, 3 regions)]
    clickq[[Click buffer]]

    client_w --> create --> dedup
    dedup -- "no match" --> gen --> store
    dedup -- "match, not force_new" --> client_w
    client_r --> redirect --> cache
    cache -- "miss" --> store
    store -- "backfill" --> cache
    redirect --> client_r
    redirect --> clickq
    clickq -- "flush every 10 s" --> store
```

A create from an authenticated caller first looks up the dedup table for the caller's owner id and the submitted URL's hash (an anonymous call skips this entirely, since the table is keyed by owner id); on a live match, unless `force_new` was set, it returns the existing code without touching anything else. Otherwise the generator draws a random code and sends a uniqueness-constrained insert to the leader of that code's shard, retrying on the rare collision; an authenticated create then writes its dedup row (data model). Each shard is one replication group with a replica in each of three regions, and only its leader decides whether a code is free, so two regions can never hand out the same code; the insert commits once two of the three replicas have it, so creates survive the loss of any one region. A redirect reads its own region: the regional cache first, then the regional replica on a miss, which also backfills the cache. A replica may trail the leader, so when it has no row the redirect service asks the shard leader before answering `404` — this is what makes a new code redirectable everywhere the instant its create returns. On success the redirect service replies with the `302` and adds the click to an in-memory buffer that a background flush aggregates into `click_count`, off the request path entirely.

### Deep dives

**Short-code generation.** Three ways to produce the code: (1) a monotonic counter, base62-encoded — collision-free by construction; to avoid contending on every create, each instance reserves a "segment" (the next 1,000 ids from one shared, atomically incremented row) and hands it out locally. Its real cost is that adjacent codes are adjacent integers: anyone can walk `base62(0), base62(1), ...` and enumerate the whole corpus, learning of every link, private or not, and how fast they grow. (2) The first $k$ base62 characters of a hash of the normalized URL — the same URL always yields the same code, which looks like dedup for free, but it would also merge different owners and anonymous callers, which the dedup rules forbid. A good hash is uniform over the $62^k$ codes, so two *different* URLs collide like two random draws: the expected number of colliding pairs among $n$ URLs is $\binom{n}{2}/N$, about 681,000 at $k=7$ over 5 years (the same size as $R$, but a different quantity), each a pair of URLs silently sharing one code unless a collision check is added. A custom alias is not the hash of anything, so it would need a second uniqueness mechanism anyway. (3) A uniformly random $k$-character draw from a cryptographically secure generator (so codes already seen do not predict the next ones), with a uniqueness-constrained insert (an insert that only succeeds if the code is free, never a separate check-then-insert in application code, which would race under concurrent creates) — chosen here, because it needs no coordinated counter service and a code says nothing about its neighbours or its age. The cost is the retry math of the requirements estimate: even at the year-5 size only about 1 insert in 1,608 needs an extra attempt. By the same odds a random guess finds a live link once per 1,608 tries, and every miss costs a read at the shard leader (architecture), so `404`s are rate-limited per client. A custom alias uses the same uniqueness-constrained insert, with one difference: on conflict it returns an error to the caller instead of retrying with a different string, since the caller asked for that exact one.

**Read path.** Each region runs its own cache cluster in front of its store replica. A region fetches about 2.3 million distinct codes a day, under 300 MB, so nothing is evicted for space, and the TTL alone sets the hit rate: every expiry forces one miss. If a code gets $x$ requests per TTL window on average, each miss starts a window that serves about $x$ hits, so its hit fraction is $x/(1+x)$; summed over the Zipf pool with a third of the traffic per region, a 120-second TTL gives only about 71% (about 2,000 store reads per second at peak), a 24-hour TTL about 95.3%. Delete consistency therefore cannot come from a short TTL. Instead, each region's invalidator tails its store replica's change log from a checkpoint, and for every delete the replica applies it overwrites the cache entry with a `deleted` tombstone (a set, not a removal), while a miss backfills with add-if-absent: a read that fetched the row just before the delete cannot write it back just after, and a restarted invalidator resumes from its checkpoint rather than losing messages. A deleted code stops redirecting in each region within that region's replication lag, normally under a second; the 24-hour TTL only bounds the damage from a bug on that path, and expiry needs none of this, since each entry carries `expires_at`. A CDN in front of the redirects was rejected: an edge stores a `302` only if its `Cache-Control` or the CDN's own configuration allows it, and a redirect answered at the edge never reaches the click buffer, so counts would have to come from edge logs and every delete would need an edge purge too.

**Storage and scale.** The link store is a sharded key-value store with conditional writes, sharded by a hash of `short_code` rather than by key range: random codes would spread evenly either way, but custom aliases cluster around common words, and hashing spreads them too. The dedup table (data model) lives on the same nodes under its own key; the listing index is kept eventually consistent, since it is never on the redirect path. At about 650 GB per copy, a 150 GB-per-node budget needs five shards; with one replica per region that is 15 storage nodes — sized by data volume, since everything the store absorbs at peak (about 330 cache-miss reads plus under 70 creates) would fit on a single node. Expired or deleted codes are never reassigned (storage is cheap enough that recycling buys nothing but risk), so "cleanup" is only a batch job flipping `status` to `expired` for listings. Clicks are summed per code in each redirect instance's memory and flushed every 10 seconds as one increment per code at its shard leader. By Little's law, $L=\lambda W$ with $W = 5$ s (the average wait until the next flush), about $6{,}944\times5\approx34{,}700$ clicks are unflushed across the fleet at peak; since the count only needs to be approximate, the buffer has no backing store, and a crashed instance loses at most its last 10 seconds of clicks. Even without aggregation each of the five shard leaders would take at most about 1,389 increments per second at peak. Creates are limited per API key or IP by a token bucket, and each URL is checked against a malicious-URL blocklist at creation and re-checked periodically.

### Follow-ups

- If a shard's leader fails, creates that land on that shard wait for a new leader (seconds); a generated code can simply be redrawn onto another shard, so only a custom alias has to wait. Redirects of codes already in the regional replica are unaffected.
- Branded, per-owner domains would key the store by `(domain, short_code)` instead of `short_code` alone, and add certificate provisioning per domain — both left out of this design.
- A URL flagged by a later blocklist re-check is retired like a delete, through the same tombstone path; clicks served before the flag are not retroactively recalled.
- Two different owners (or two anonymous callers) end up with two different codes for the same destination — dedup is scoped per owner on purpose, so the platform never merges them or their click counts.
