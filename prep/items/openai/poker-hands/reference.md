Confirm with the interviewer that suit never breaks a tie once ranks match — the rules above already say so, but some card games do rank suits, and it is cheap to ask before writing any comparison code. Then map every hand to a single comparable tuple `(type_priority, tie_break)`, where `tie_break` has the same shape for every hand of a given type: a 1-tuple for Three of a Kind, a 2-tuple `(pair_rank, kicker)` for Pair, a 3-tuple of sorted ranks for High Card (and, from Part 2 on, for Flush). Once every hand reduces to one such tuple, `compare_hands` and `rank_players` are one line each, and Part 2's flush and Part 3's showdown reuse that same tuple with no new comparison logic.

### Part 1

```python
RANKS = "23456789TJQKA"  # index doubles as the rank's numeric value
TYPE_NAMES = ["High Card", "Pair", "Three of a Kind"]  # indexed by the priority inside a hand key


def _rank_value(card):
    return RANKS.index(card[0])


def _hand_key(cards):
    ranks = sorted((_rank_value(c) for c in cards), reverse=True)
    if ranks[0] == ranks[1] == ranks[2]:
        return (2, (ranks[0],))
    if ranks[0] == ranks[1]:                # NOTE: after a descending sort the pair is always adjacent,
        return (1, (ranks[0], ranks[2]))    #       at [0]/[1] or at [1]/[2] -- it can never be split
    if ranks[1] == ranks[2]:
        return (1, (ranks[1], ranks[0]))
    return (0, tuple(ranks))


def hand_type(cards):
    return TYPE_NAMES[_hand_key(cards)[0]]


def compare_hands(cards_a, cards_b):
    ka, kb = _hand_key(cards_a), _hand_key(cards_b)
    return 0 if ka == kb else (1 if ka > kb else -1)  # NOTE: tuples compare lexicographically, so the
                                                      #       priority always dominates the tie-break


def rank_players(hands):
    keys = [_hand_key(h) for h in hands]
    best = max(keys)
    return [i for i, k in enumerate(keys) if k == best]
```

Calling `rank_players` on the Part 1 example reproduces `[0, 1]`.

### Part 2

Flush slots between Three of a Kind and Pair, so the only priority that moves is Three of a Kind's, from 2 to 3; the flush's own tie-break is the 3-tuple of sorted ranks already used for High Card. Everything about the ranks is unchanged, so the new `_hand_key` calls the old one and patches its result rather than restating the rank rules. `hand_type`, `compare_hands` and `rank_players` look up `TYPE_NAMES` and `_hand_key` by name on every call, so the new rules reach all three untouched.

```python
_ranks_only_key = _hand_key                                     # Part 1's key, suits ignored
TYPE_NAMES = ["High Card", "Pair", "Flush", "Three of a Kind"]  # flush slots in above pair


def _hand_key(cards):  # supersedes Part 1's version
    priority, tie_break = _ranks_only_key(cards)
    if priority == 2:                                 # NOTE: three of a kind is settled before the suits
        return (3, tie_break)                         #       are looked at, so it never reads as a flush
    if len({c[1] for c in cards}) == 1:
        return (2, tuple(sorted((_rank_value(c) for c in cards), reverse=True)))
    return (priority, tie_break)
```

Calling `rank_players` on the Part 2 example now returns `[0]`.

### Part 3

`PokerRound` keeps one running counter, `calls_made`, and reads off both the pass number and the player to visit from it with `divmod`, instead of tracking two separate loop variables. A single `next_card` pointer into `deck` is advanced only when a card is actually dealt, which is exactly what makes a fold "free" — the next player to draw always gets the next *undrawn* card, whether or not the player before them folded.

```python
def never_fold(first_two):
    return False


def fold_unless_pair(first_two):
    return first_two[0][0] != first_two[1][0]


def fold_unless_flush_draw(first_two):
    return first_two[0][1] != first_two[1][1]


class PokerRound:
    def __init__(self, num_players, deck, strategies):
        assert len(deck) >= 3 * num_players and len(set(deck)) == len(deck)
        self.num_players = num_players
        self.deck = deck
        self.strategies = strategies
        self.hands = [[] for _ in range(num_players)]
        self.folded = [False] * num_players
        self.next_card = 0        # NOTE: one running pointer -- a fold never advances it
        self.calls_made = 0

    def is_over(self):
        return self.calls_made >= 3 * self.num_players

    def deal_card(self):
        pass_no, player = divmod(self.calls_made, self.num_players)  # NOTE: pass_no is 0, 1 or 2
        self.calls_made += 1
        if pass_no == 2 and self.strategies[player](self.hands[player]):
            self.folded[player] = True
            return f"Player {player} folds."
        card = self.deck[self.next_card]
        self.next_card += 1
        self.hands[player].append(card)
        return f"Player {player} is dealt {card}."

    def check_result(self):
        active = [i for i in range(self.num_players) if not self.folded[i]]
        if not active:
            return "No winner: all players folded."
        if len(active) == 1:
            return f"Winner: Player {active[0]}"
        keys = {i: _hand_key(self.hands[i]) for i in active}
        best = max(keys.values())
        winners = [i for i in active if keys[i] == best]
        if len(winners) == 1:
            return f"Winner: Player {winners[0]}"
        return "Winner: Tie (Players " + ", ".join(str(i) for i in winners) + ")"


def play_round(num_players, deck, strategies):
    game = PokerRound(num_players, deck, strategies)
    log = []
    while not game.is_over():
        log.append(game.deal_card())
    log.append(game.check_result())
    return log
```

Calling `play_round(3, ["3S", "TD", "8H", "QC", "TS", "4H", "2D", "6H", "7C"], [fold_unless_pair, never_fold, fold_unless_flush_draw])` reproduces the Part 3 example.

### Follow-ups

- Folding never consumes a `deck` card, so a `deck` sized for the worst case (`3 * num_players`, nobody folds) is always enough; a shorter one could run out mid-round if too few players end up folding.
- Every part does O(1) work per card (a hand has exactly three of them), so all three parts run in O(total cards dealt).
- A five-card hand needs more tie-break shapes (two pair, straight, full house, ...), but the same idea carries over: map every hand to a tuple whose first coordinate is the type priority and whose remainder is only ever compared within that type.
- Choosing a fold rule to beat a known opponent strategy is a different, harder question — the expected value of folding versus continuing, averaged over the unseen cards left in the deck — and is not covered by the rules or the code above.

```python
p0, p1, p2 = ["7H", "7D", "4C"], ["7S", "7C", "4D"], ["KD", "QS", "JC"]
assert [hand_type(p) for p in (p0, p1, p2)] == ["Pair", "Pair", "High Card"]

assert [hand_type(p) for p in (p0, p1, p2)] == ["Flush", "Pair", "High Card"]
assert rank_players([p0, p1, p2]) == [0]
