Worth confirming first: the tie-break when several shards share both `start` and `end` (id order here), and whether `rebalance` may mutate the `Shard` objects passed in (this implementation does not).

### Part 1

The shift rule is exactly the classic greedy for assigning jobs to the earliest-available one of `limit` identical machines (interval partitioning / "meeting rooms" with a fixed room count). Track, for each machine, the next key at which it is free (every machine starts free). Give shard $s$ to the machine with the smallest free key $t$: if $t \le s.start$, $s$ keeps its own start, otherwise its start becomes $t$; if that start is past $s.end$, hand the machine back unused and drop $s$, otherwise the machine's free key becomes $s.end + 1$.

This start, $\max(s.start, t)$, is exactly the key the rule looks for. Every machine is busy on every key from $s.start$ up to its free key minus one: its latest range either kept its own start, which is at most $s.start$ because shards arrive in start order, or was shifted to begin right where the machine's previous range ended, and the same argument applies to that range. So every key in $[s.start, t - 1]$ is covered by all `limit` machines, while at $\max(s.start, t)$ the chosen machine is free; when that key is past $s.end$, the rule drops $s$, as step 3 requires.

Because a shard only ever joins a machine once that machine's previous range has fully ended, every machine's own assigned ranges are pairwise disjoint, so at most one of them can cover any given key -- with `limit` machines, coverage can never exceed `limit`. A single shift is enough, with no need to check further inside $[\text{new start}, s.end]$ for a later key where coverage climbs back to `limit`: the chosen machine has the *smallest* free key among all `limit` machines, so once it is free it stays free at every later key too, contributing $0$ there for good; the other `limit - 1` machines contribute at most $1$ each, so together they cover any key at or past $\text{new start}$ at most `limit - 1` times, and adding $s$ brings that to at most `limit`.

Shifts never open a hole: every key a shift skips, and every key of a dropped shard, already has coverage `limit` $\ge 1$ among the kept shards, and kept shards are never shortened afterwards. So the holes of step 5 are exactly the holes already present in the input, and filling each with a single shard raises its coverage from $0$ to $1$.

```python
import heapq

NEG_INF = float('-inf')


class Shard:
    def __init__(self, id, start, end):
        self.id, self.start, self.end = id, start, end

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Shard({self.id!r}, {self.start}, {self.end})"


def rebalance(limit, shards):
    if not shards:
        return []
    order = sorted(shards, key=lambda sh: (sh.start, sh.end, sh.id))

    free_times = []    # min-heap of "next free key" for machines in use; size <= limit
    kept = []
    for sh in order:
        if len(free_times) < limit:
            t_min = NEG_INF                       # an unused machine: always free
        else:
            t_min = heapq.heappop(free_times)
        new_start = sh.start if t_min <= sh.start else t_min
        if new_start > sh.end:
            if t_min != NEG_INF:
                heapq.heappush(free_times, t_min)  # NOTE: hand the machine back unused, don't drop it
            continue
        kept.append(Shard(sh.id, new_start, sh.end))
        heapq.heappush(free_times, sh.end + 1)

    if not kept:
        return []

    # Gap fill: scan the kept shards in (start, end, id) order of their step-4 ranges.
    kept.sort(key=lambda sh: (sh.start, sh.end, sh.id))
    frontier = kept[0].start - 1        # NOTE: the very first PROCESSED shard is never shifted (the
    frontier_owner = None               #       heap starts empty), so kept[0].start == min(all starts)
    for sh in kept:
        if sh.start > frontier + 1:
            frontier_owner.end = sh.start - 1     # NOTE: only stretches over keys with coverage 0
        if sh.end > frontier:           # NOTE: strict '>': ties go to the smallest (start, id)
            frontier, frontier_owner = sh.end, sh
    # NOTE: no hole after the last kept shard -- the largest input end is always covered

    kept.sort(key=lambda sh: (sh.start, sh.end, sh.id))
    return kept
```

Sorting is $O(n \log n)$; the heap never holds more than `limit` free times, so each of the $n$ shards costs $O(\log(\min(n, limit)))$ for one pop and one push, and the two sorts in the gap-fill pass are $O(n \log n)$ again -- $O(n \log n)$ total, and no step ever inspects an individual key.

### Part 2

Use *consistent hashing* with *virtual nodes*: hash each shard to `num_vnodes` points (vnodes) on a ring of hash values, hash each key onto the same ring, and give the key to the nearest vnode clockwise from it, wrapping past the largest back to the smallest. Hash with `hashlib.md5` -- not the built-in `hash()`, which `PYTHONHASHSEED` randomizes across processes -- so the vnode positions depend only on the shard ids, as the first requirement asks. Keep the ring as two parallel lists sorted by hash; `locate` is a `bisect` lookup for the first vnode at or after the key's own hash, wrapping to index 0 past the end.

A key's owner is the nearest vnode clockwise from it. Inserting one new vnode $v$ changes the owner of exactly the keys in the arc between $v$ and the vnode immediately before it -- they move from whatever shard owned that whole arc before to $v$'s shard; every other arc, and hence every other key, is untouched. Removing a vnode is the same statement backwards: its arc's keys move to the vnode now immediately after it, and nothing else changes. Since `add_shard` and `remove_shard` each touch exactly `num_vnodes` such arcs, only keys in those arcs ever move.

The vnodes are there for the third requirement. With one point per shard, arc lengths vary widely: among 20 shards, the largest share measured was 3.5 times the fair $1/N$. A shard's share is the sum of `num_vnodes` independent arcs, so its relative spread shrinks to about $1/\sqrt{\text{num\_vnodes}}$: 8% at 150, and 11% measured over the same 20 shards.

```python
import bisect
import hashlib


def _ring_hash(text):
    return int(hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest(), 16)


class ShardRouter:
    def __init__(self, num_vnodes=150):
        self.num_vnodes = num_vnodes
        self._ring_hashes = []     # sorted
        self._ring_owner = []      # _ring_owner[i] owns _ring_hashes[i]
        self._shards = set()

    def add_shard(self, shard_id):
        if shard_id in self._shards:
            raise ValueError(f"shard already present: {shard_id}")
        self._shards.add(shard_id)
        for v in range(self.num_vnodes):
            h = _ring_hash(f"{shard_id}#{v}")
            i = bisect.bisect_left(self._ring_hashes, h)
            self._ring_hashes.insert(i, h)          # NOTE: O(T) per insertion -- a plain sorted list
            self._ring_owner.insert(i, shard_id)

    def remove_shard(self, shard_id):
        if shard_id not in self._shards:
            raise ValueError(f"no such shard: {shard_id}")
        self._shards.discard(shard_id)
        keep = [(h, o) for h, o in zip(self._ring_hashes, self._ring_owner) if o != shard_id]
        self._ring_hashes = [h for h, _ in keep]
        self._ring_owner = [o for _, o in keep]

    def locate(self, key):
        if not self._ring_hashes:
            raise LookupError("locate() called with no shards")
        h = _ring_hash(str(key))
        i = bisect.bisect_left(self._ring_hashes, h)
        if i == len(self._ring_hashes):
            i = 0                                   # wrap past the largest hash
        return self._ring_owner[i]
```

`locate` is $O(\log T)$ for a ring of $T$ vnodes total. `add_shard` does `num_vnodes` separate `list.insert` calls, each $O(T)$ to shift the tail of the list, so $O(\text{num\_vnodes} \cdot T)$ per call; `remove_shard` rebuilds both lists in one linear pass instead, so it costs $O(T)$ regardless of `num_vnodes`. A balanced tree or skip list in place of the plain list would bring `add_shard` down to $O(\text{num\_vnodes} \log T)$ too. With 12 shards and 150 virtual nodes each, adding a 13th shard moved 8.1% of the keys `0..19_999`, close to the $1/13 \approx 7.7\%$ an evenly split ring would move; removing one of the 13 moved 8.4%. *Rendezvous hashing* (each key goes to the shard with the largest hash of the pair `(key, shard_id)`) meets the same three requirements without a ring, at $O(N)$ per `locate`.

### Follow-ups

- Part 1's rule does not explicitly minimize how much data moves; it only ever moves a start or an end forward. What that costs depends on whether movement is counted in keys or in bytes, which diverge when per-key payload sizes vary a lot between shards.
- The processing order decides who yields: among shards with the same start, the shorter ones are processed first and the longer ones take the shifts. Processing large or long-lived shards first instead breaks the start-only shift, since a later shard's keys at coverage `limit` may then sit in the middle of its range.
- The hash ring in Part 2 balances key *count* per shard, not query rate; a shard that is hot because of a handful of very popular keys needs separate handling, such as routing those keys through a per-key override table or replicating them.
- Adding one new range shard to an already-rebalanced Part 1 output does not need a full re-run: only the kept shards whose range intersects the new one can change, plus, if the new shard starts past the envelope's end with a hole in between, the kept shard extended to meet it.
