Worth confirming with the interviewer before coding: that symbolic links are resolved physically, as `cd -P` does, rather than lexically, and what a cycle should produce (here, an exception once a fixed number of expansions is exceeded). Parts 2 and 3 both reuse the token-by-token walk of Part 1 instead of re-deriving it.

### Part 1

The current directory and the destination are both just sequences of components; the whole problem is walking them with a stack.

```python
def _split(path: str) -> list[str]:
    return [tok for tok in path.split("/") if tok != ""]     # NOTE: drops "" from //, a leading /, or a trailing /


def _apply(stack: list[str], token: str) -> None:
    if token in ("", "."):
        return
    if token == "..":
        if stack:                # NOTE: popping an empty stack is the root clamp, not an error
            stack.pop()
        return
    stack.append(token)


def cd_relative(cwd: str, destination: str) -> str:
    stack = _split(cwd)
    for token in destination.split("/"):        # NOTE: split, not _split -- "" tokens must reach _apply
        _apply(stack, token)
    return "/" + "/".join(stack)                 # NOTE: build the leading "/" here; join([]) is "", not "/"
```

### Part 2

`destination` first gets classified into a starting point (`base`) and a remaining relative tail (`rest`); from there it is exactly the walk of Part 1.

```python
def _start(cwd: str, destination: str, home: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
    if destination == "~" or destination.startswith("~/"):
        return home, destination[2:]      # NOTE: "~"[2:] is "", so a bare "~" lands exactly on home
    if destination.startswith("~"):
        raise ValueError(f"unsupported destination: {destination!r} (~user is out of scope)")
    if destination.startswith("/"):
        return "/", destination           # NOTE: destination's own leading "/" becomes an "" token, dropped by _apply
    return cwd, destination               # NOTE: only a leading "~" is special; "a/~b" falls through to here


def cd_absolute(cwd: str, destination: str, home: str) -> str:
    base, rest = _start(cwd, destination, home)
    stack = _split(base)
    for token in rest.split("/"):
        _apply(stack, token)
    return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```

### Part 3

The key is to check for a symbolic link *immediately after each component is pushed*, before any later `..` has a chance to remove it lexically. With `symlinks = {"/srv/www/current": "/srv/archive/2025-09"}` and `destination = "current/../snapshot"`, pushing `current` matches the link right away and swaps the stack for the target; the `..` that follows then pops `2025-09`, giving `"/srv/archive/snapshot"`. A version that first cancels `current/..` as plain strings never even looks the link up and returns `"/srv/www/snapshot"` instead — a different directory, silently.

Concretely, the walk keeps a queue of components still to be followed. A name that is not a link is pushed onto the stack. On a match, an absolute target first empties the stack (for a relative target the stack already holds the link's own directory), and the target's components go to the front of the queue — so they go through the very same push-then-check step, which is what makes a target that lands on, or passes through, another link keep resolving.

```python
from collections import deque


class SymlinkLoopError(Exception):
    pass


MAX_SYMLINK_HOPS = 20   # NOTE: a choice of this problem; Linux (kernel lookup and glibc realpath) fails with ELOOP after 40


def cd(cwd: str, destination: str, home: str, symlinks: dict[str, str]) -> str:
    base, rest = _start(cwd, destination, home)
    stack = _split(base)                  # physical already: cwd and home never lie under a link
    pending = deque(rest.split("/"))
    hops = 0
    while pending:
        token = pending.popleft()
        if token in ("", ".", ".."):
            _apply(stack, token)          # NOTE: ".." pops the PHYSICAL stack -- already past any earlier link
            continue
        target = symlinks.get("/" + "/".join(stack + [token]))   # the path this token would create
        if target is None:
            stack.append(token)
            continue
        hops += 1
        if hops > MAX_SYMLINK_HOPS:
            raise SymlinkLoopError(f"more than {MAX_SYMLINK_HOPS} symlink expansions resolving {destination!r}")
        if target.startswith("/"):
            stack = []
        # NOTE: otherwise `stack` is still the directory that contains the link -- the base of a relative target
        pending.extendleft(reversed(target.split("/")))
    return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```

In a cycle such as `a → b → a`, every expansion puts another link at the front of the queue, so the walk would never end; the hop counter turns that into a `SymlinkLoopError`. This is deliberately not "raise the first time a link is seen twice": a link that points at its own containing directory is legitimate and can appear in `destination` several times in a row (`self/self/self/x` behind `{"/srv/shared/self": "."}` resolves to `"/srv/shared/x"` in three hops, well under the cap), so a seen-before set would reject valid input. Linux bounds the count the same way: after `ln -s . loop`, both the kernel and glibc's `realpath()` resolve a path made of 40 `loop/` components and fail with `ELOOP` ("Too many levels of symbolic links") only at the 41st.

### Part 4

A process's current working directory is state that belongs to that process — the kernel keeps one for each process. `fork()` gives a child a copy of it, but afterwards the two are independent: a child that calls `chdir()` only moves itself, and once it exits, the parent's own working directory is exactly as it was. So if `cd` ran the way an ordinary command does — the shell forking a child process that execs `cd` and calls `chdir()` — only that short-lived child would move, and the interactive shell itself would never leave its old directory. The only way `cd` can move the shell itself is to run inside the shell's own process, with no fork or exec, which is what "shell built-in" means: when the shell looks up the command name (after expanding the command line), it finds `cd` among its built-ins and runs it directly instead of searching `$PATH` for a program to run.

The built-in itself does roughly this. The shell has already expanded `~`, variables and quotes in the argument; `cd` itself treats an argument of `-` as `$OLDPWD`. It computes the new directory, lexically for a plain `cd` (text manipulation of the shell's own `$PWD`, the same rules as Parts 1–2; this computed path is what it passes to `chdir()`) or physically for `cd -P` (following symbolic links and applying `..` to the real directory tree, as in Part 3). It then calls the `chdir()` system call and, if that succeeds, updates `$PWD` and `$OLDPWD`. If it fails — the directory does not exist, or a component along the way is not a directory or is not searchable — `chdir()` returns an error and the shell reports it without changing its working directory.

### Follow-ups

- `CDPATH`: for a relative `destination` whose first component is not `.` or `..`, a POSIX shell first tries each directory listed in `$CDPATH` as the parent and falls back to the current directory only if none of them has it (printing the new directory when it came from `CDPATH`). It is a shell search convenience, not part of this problem's `cd()`.
- `cd -` changes to `$OLDPWD`, prints the new directory, and leaves `$PWD` and `$OLDPWD` swapped.
- A destination that does not exist makes the real `chdir()` fail with `ENOENT`; this problem never touches the filesystem, so that case does not arise here.
- Linux refuses to create a hard link to a directory (`link()` fails with `EPERM`, even for root): the directory would get two parents, making `..` ambiguous, and a link to one of its own ancestors would put a cycle into a tree that tools such as `du` and `fsck` walk on the assumption that it has none.
- The working directory is process-wide, not per-thread: two threads of one process share it, so one thread's `chdir()` moves the other too — the opposite of the parent/child isolation that makes `cd` need to be a built-in in the first place.
