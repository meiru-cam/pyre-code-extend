Confirm with the interviewer before coding: whether the queries come one at a time or as an `(m, d)` batch; whether "no loops" also excludes comprehensions and `np.vectorize` (assumed here); the distance and the rule for ties; and in Part 2 whether the layer is wanted for a column vector, $W_1 q + b_1$, or for a batch of rows, `X_query @ W + b`.

### Part 1

The direct loop-free version subtracts with broadcasting, `X_query[:, None, :] - X_train[None, :, :]`, then squares and sums over the last axis. It is correct but allocates an `(m, n, d)` array. Expanding the square removes the third axis:

$$\lVert q - x \rVert^2 = (q - x)^\top (q - x) = \lVert q \rVert^2 - 2 q^\top x + \lVert x \rVert^2 .$$

With $Q$ = `X_query` and $X$ = `X_train`, entry $(j, i)$ of the $m \times n$ matrix of squared distances is

$$D_{ji} = \lVert q_j \rVert^2 + \lVert x_i \rVert^2 - 2 (Q X^\top)_{ji} .$$

The three terms have shapes `(m, 1)`, `(n,)` and `(m, n)`, and broadcasting adds them to `(m, n)`. The matrix product dominates: $O(mnd)$ time and $O(mn)$ extra memory. The square root is increasing, so the Euclidean distance itself has the same argmin and is never needed.

```python
import numpy as np


def nearest_indices(X_train, X_query):
    sq_train = (X_train ** 2).sum(axis=1)                           # (n,)    |x_i|^2
    sq_query = (X_query ** 2).sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)            # (m, 1)  |q_j|^2
    # NOTE: keepdims=True. With shape (m,) the sum below raises "operands could not be broadcast together"
    #       if m != n, and if m == n it silently adds |q_j|^2 to COLUMN j, which changes the argmin.
    inner = X_query @ X_train.T                                     # (m, d) @ (d, n) -> (m, n)
    sqdist = sq_query + sq_train - 2.0 * inner                      # (m, 1) + (n,) - (m, n) -> (m, n)
    # NOTE: rounding can leave entries such as -7e-15. Harmless for argmin; clip at 0 before any sqrt.
    # NOTE: axis=1 runs over the training points, and argmin returns the FIRST minimum, which is the tie rule.
    return np.argmin(sqdist, axis=1)                                # (m,)


def predict_1nn(X_train, y_train, X_query):
    return y_train[nearest_indices(X_train, X_query)]               # integer-array indexing: (n,)[(m,)] -> (m,)
```

### Part 2

**(a)** Fix a query $q$ and look at its row of $D$. The term $\lVert q \rVert^2$ is the same for every $i$. It shifts the whole row by a constant, so it changes neither the index of the minimum nor which entries tie. Drop it and flip the sign:

$$z_i = 2 x_i^\top q - \lVert x_i \rVert^2 = \lVert q \rVert^2 - \lVert q - x_i \rVert^2 .$$

This is affine in $q$, namely $z = W_1 q + b_1$ with

$$W_1 = 2X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d} \quad (\text{row } i \text{ is } 2 x_i^\top), \qquad (b_1)_i = -\lVert x_i \rVert^2 ,$$

and both depend on the training set only. Because $z_i$ is a constant minus the squared distance, $z$ is largest exactly where the distance is smallest, so $\arg\max_i z_i = \mathrm{nn}(q)$ with the same ties. The dropped term is quadratic in $q$, so no affine layer could have produced it. It is not needed only because the argmax ignores a shift.

The softmax does not change the argmax. All $p_i = \mathrm{softmax}(z)_i$ share one positive denominator and $t \mapsto e^t$ is strictly increasing, so $p_i > p_k$ if and only if $z_i > z_k$, and $p_i = p_k$ if and only if $z_i = z_k$. Order and ties are preserved.

For the data of Part 1 and the query $q_1 = (2, 1)$ with $\lVert q_1 \rVert^2 = 5$:

```math
W_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 4 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \\ 6 & 6 \end{pmatrix},\quad
b_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -4 \\ -4 \\ -18 \end{pmatrix},\quad
z = W_1 q_1 + b_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},\quad
5 - z = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \\ 5 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
```

The last vector is the row of $q_1$ in the table of Part 1. The pair $(W_1, b_1)$ is not unique: $(cW_1, cb_1 + t\mathbf{1})$ with any $c > 0$ and any $t$ has the same argmax, and $c$ acts as an inverse temperature. With $c = 1$ the softmax cancels the shift by $\lVert q \rVert^2$ as well, so the probabilities are Gaussian kernel weights, $p_i = e^{-\lVert q - x_i \rVert^2} / \sum_k e^{-\lVert q - x_k \rVert^2}$.

**(b)** Row $j$ of `logits` is the transpose of the single-query formula: $(W_1 q_j + b_1)^\top = q_j^\top W_1^\top + b_1^\top$. Stacking the $m$ rows gives $Z = Q W_1^\top + \mathbf{1} b_1^\top$, hence `W = W_1.T = 2 * X_train.T` of shape `(d, n)`, and `b = b_1`, which broadcasting adds to every row. `torch.nn.Linear(d, n)` uses both conventions at once: it stores a weight of shape `(n, d)`, which is $W_1$, and computes `x @ weight.T + bias`.

```python
def affine_layer(X_train):
    # NOTE: W is the TRANSPOSE of W_1, column i is 2 x_i. Without .T, X_query @ W raises a shape error
    #       if d != n and is silently wrong if d == n.
    W = 2.0 * X_train.T                                 # (d, n)
    b = -(X_train ** 2).sum(axis=1)                     # (n,)
    return W, b


def softmax(Z):
    # NOTE: the logits grow like |x|^2. np.exp(1000.0) is inf and inf / inf is nan, so shift every row to max 0.
    E = np.exp(Z - Z.max(axis=1, keepdims=True))        # (m, n) - (m, 1) -> (m, n)
    # NOTE: axis=1, one distribution per query. axis=0 runs without an error and changes the argmax.
    return E / E.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)             # (m, n) / (m, 1) -> (m, n)


def predict_1nn_affine(X_train, y_train, X_query):
    W, b = affine_layer(X_train)
    logits = X_query @ W + b                            # (m, d) @ (d, n) + (n,) -> (m, n)
    # NOTE: b of shape (n,) lines up with the LAST axis of (m, n), so it is added to every row.
    probs = softmax(logits)                             # (m, n), every row sums to 1
    nearest = np.argmax(probs, axis=1)                  # (m,)
    # NOTE: in floating point the softmax can turn two distinct logits into a tie: softmax([[-1e-17, 0.]])
    #       is [[0.5, 0.5]], and the argmax moves from 1 to 0. np.argmax(logits, axis=1) avoids this.
    return probs, y_train[nearest]
```

The layer has one output unit per training point and $nd + n$ parameters, none of them trained: the network stores the training set in its weights.

### Follow-ups

- **A score per class.** With the one-hot label matrix `Y` of shape `(n, c)`, `probs @ Y` has shape `(m, c)` and is a second linear layer. It is a vote of all training points with the kernel weights above and can disagree with 1-NN (example in the checks); the 1-NN label needs the argmax over the training points first and the lookup in `y_train` second.
- **L1 distance.** One affine layer with an argmax cannot represent it: the set of $q$ where unit $i$ wins is an intersection of half-spaces, hence convex, while an L1 nearest-neighbour cell need not be. Two layers are enough: $nd$ hidden units $q_k - x_{ik}$ with the activation $\lvert t \rvert$, then minus the sum of each group of $d$ units (both in the checks).
- **Cosine similarity.** Divide every training row by its norm and use $W = \hat{X}^\top$, $b = 0$. The norm of the query is a positive factor common to its whole row of logits and does not move the argmax.
- **$m \times n$ does not fit in memory.** Build `W` and `b` once and send `X_query` through in blocks of $B$ rows. The rows are independent, so the result is identical and the extra memory is $O(Bn)$.
- **Complexity.** $O(mnd)$ time, dominated by the matrix product, and $O(mn)$ extra memory, against $O(mnd)$ memory for the broadcast difference. For very large $n$, exact search gives way to an approximate nearest-neighbour index such as HNSW or IVF.
