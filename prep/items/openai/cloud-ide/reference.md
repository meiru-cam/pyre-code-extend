Worth confirming before designing: whether sandboxes need general outbound internet access or only package registries. This design assumes only registries.

### Requirements and scale

**Workspace-start rate.** A sandbox stays live through the session and then through the 15-minute idle timeout after the last tab closes, so it is held for $W = 20 + 15 = 35$ min $= 2{,}100$ s. By Little's law, $L = \lambda \cdot W$, with $L = 36{,}000$ live sandboxes at peak,

$$\lambda_{\text{peak}} = L / W \approx 17.1 \text{ workspace starts (or resumes) per second.}$$

Of these, about $\lambda_{\text{peak}} \times 1{,}200 \approx 20{,}600$ are in an active session and the other 15,400 are waiting out the timeout.

**Sandbox-fleet size.** Assume each host offers sandboxes 96 vCPUs and 192 GiB after the host's own share — the quota's 1 : 2 ratio, so neither resource is stranded — which fits $96/2 = 192/4 = 48$ sandboxes. $36{,}000 / 48 = 750$ hosts; 20% headroom for hosts booting, draining or failing health checks, and for the warm pool, makes **900 hosts** ($43{,}200$ slots).

**Warm-pool size.** Each claim from the pool triggers a replacement that takes $T_{\text{create}} = 7$ s (the cold path). The pool, counting sandboxes still booting, runs dry only if more claims arrive within one refill time than it holds; by Little's law again, $\lambda_{\text{peak}} \cdot T_{\text{create}} = 120$ replacements are in flight at peak. A 1.5x burst margin gives **180 warm sandboxes**, under four hosts' worth of slots, each holding a real 2 vCPU/4 GiB.

**Terminal-output bandwidth.** If 35% of the ≈20,600 active sessions have a process printing at any instant, that is $7{,}200$ streams at an average 600 B/s, $\approx 4.3$ MB/s ($\approx 35$ Mb/s) — negligible; the Gateway is sized by its ≈20,600 concurrent WebSockets instead.

**Persistent storage.** If 40% of the 2,000,000 registered users keep a workspace, that is $800{,}000$ workspaces averaging 350 MB of files and packages: **280 TB** of used bytes. Reserving each volume's full 10 GiB quota would take about 8.6 PB, 30 times as much, so volumes are thin-provisioned.

### Data model and API

**Workspace** — `id`, `owner_id`, `name`, `template`, `sharing` (`{mode: "private" | "view" | "edit", principals}`), `status`, `generation` (an integer bumped every time a new `Sandbox` is assigned — the fencing token), `current_sandbox_id` (set only while `status` is `running`, `hibernating` or `resuming`), `idle_since` (set when the last connection closes with no foreground process running, else null), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

`status` has six states, each transition owned by one component. The Workspace Manager moves a new workspace `creating → running` once its first sandbox reports healthy. The manager's idle sweep, or `POST /stop`, moves `running → hibernating`; the host agent then syncs the filesystem, stops the sandbox and detaches the volume, and its confirmation moves the workspace to `hibernated`. `POST /start` moves `hibernated → resuming`, the manager's lease monitor moves `running → resuming` after a host failure, and the new sandbox reporting healthy moves either back to `running`. `DELETE` moves any state to `deleted` once any live sandbox is released and the volume purged.

**Sandbox** — one row per booted sandbox: `id`, `host_id`, `workspace_id` (null while `warm`), `generation` (copied from the workspace at claim time), `status` (`provisioning | warm | attached | releasing | released`), `lease_expires_at`, `last_heartbeat_at`, `created_at`. A unique index allows at most one `attached` row per workspace.

**File** — a metadata index, not the bytes: `id`, `workspace_id`, `path`, `is_directory`, `size_bytes`, `content_hash`, `updated_at`. Every sandbox boots from its template's read-only base image, shared by all sandboxes; everything the user changes — files and installed packages alike — lands in a writable layer on the workspace's volume. The agent inside the sandbox keeps the index current (a directory such as `node_modules` is one entry), so the tree lists even while `hibernated`.

**Process** — `id`, `workspace_id`, `sandbox_id`, `generation`, `command`, `status` (`running | exited`), `exit_code`, `started_at`, `ended_at`.

**REST** (workspace lifecycle and files):

- `POST /workspaces` — `{name, template}` → `{workspace_id, status: "creating"}`.
- `POST /workspaces/{id}/start` — ensures a running sandbox (warm pool, resume, or post-failure recovery). Returns `{status, stream_token}`, `stream_token` a signed `{workspace_id, sandbox_id, host_endpoint, generation, access, exp}`.
- `POST /workspaces/{id}/stop` — user-triggered hibernate, `running → hibernating`. Returns `{status}`.
- `DELETE /workspaces/{id}` — releases any live sandbox, purges the volume, returns `{status: "deleted"}`.
- `GET /workspaces/{id}/files?path=` lists a directory from the index (works while hibernated); `PUT /workspaces/{id}/files/{path}` writes a file, requiring `status = running` (`409` + `resume_required` otherwise).

**WebSocket** (`WSS /stream/{workspace_id}?token=<stream_token>`) — one connection multiplexes every process, tagged by `process_id`, so a dev server and a test run share one socket.

Client to server: `{type: "run", command, cwd}`; `{type: "input", process_id, data}`; `{type: "resize", process_id, cols, rows}`; `{type: "cancel", process_id}`; and, only right after reconnecting, `{type: "resume", process_id, from_seq}`.

Server to client: `{type: "process_started", process_id}`; `{type: "output", process_id, seq, data}` (`seq` is the byte offset of the first byte of `data`); `{type: "process_exit", process_id, exit_code}`; `{type: "output_gap", process_id, from_seq, dropped_bytes}` when output the client never received was overwritten; and `{type: "file_changed", path, kind}` for a change made outside a `PUT`, such as a package manager writing a lockfile.

Opening a hibernated workspace goes from the API service to the Workspace Manager, which claims a `warm` sandbox from the Warm Pool Controller (which starts a replacement, or provisions one on the spot when the pool is empty), bumps `generation` and marks the `Sandbox` row `attached` in one conditional update, then attaches the workspace's volume to that host and returns a `stream_token` carrying both. Each host's host agent boots and stops sandboxes, renews their leases with the manager, and forwards connections to the agent inside each sandbox, which owns the PTYs, output buffers and file watcher. The browser opens a WebSocket to the Gateway, which dials the host address in the token (no database lookup) and carries input and output over that connection for the session. A `run` message makes the in-sandbox agent start the process on a pseudo-terminal and stream its output back; the manager and the metadata store are not on this path, so the 150 ms output target never waits on the database.

### Deep dives

**Sandbox isolation.** Three categories, in increasing isolation strength. Plain OS containers (Linux namespaces limit what a process sees, cgroups what it uses) start in well under a second, but all sandboxes share one host kernel: seccomp trims the syscall table, yet one exploitable bug in what remains exposes every tenant on the host. Containers behind a sandboxed kernel (a user-space kernel intercepts the syscalls and implements them itself — gVisor is one implementation) expose the host kernel only to the small, filtered set of calls that layer makes, so an escape needs a bug in the layer and then one in the host kernel; the price is overhead on syscall- and file-heavy work such as builds, and the occasional tool needing a syscall the layer lacks. MicroVMs (a minimal virtual machine monitor boots a guest kernel per sandbox under hardware virtualization — Firecracker is one implementation) give each sandbox its own kernel; an escape must get through the hypervisor's narrow interface, KVM plus a few emulated devices.

Choice: microVMs — every sandbox runs arbitrary commands from strangers, so the boundary is the product's core promise. Cost: hosts need hardware virtualization (bare metal or nested virtualization); every sandbox carries its own guest kernel and page cache, which containers would share; the guest boot adds on the order of a hundred milliseconds, small next to fetching the image and attaching the volume on the cold path; and placement and health checks are built in-house rather than taken from a generic container scheduler.

Two more controls sit outside the guest, where the user cannot change them. Egress reaches only a proxy that forwards to allowlisted package registries, never to internal addresses or the cloud metadata endpoint. Resources: the microVM has exactly 2 vCPUs and 4 GiB of guest memory, and the host puts its monitor process in a cgroup (`cpu.max` throttles CPU time, `memory.max` caps host-side memory) and rate-limits its disk and network devices, so a runaway build slows only itself.

**Terminal streaming and reconnection.** The in-sandbox agent starts each command on a pseudo-terminal (PTY), not a pipe, so a REPL or anything checking `isatty` behaves as it does locally; like a local terminal, the PTY merges stdout and stderr into one byte stream. The agent reads the PTY's master side, appends the bytes to a 256 KB ring buffer per process, and sends them up the Gateway connection.

The agent never stops reading the PTY: if it did, the kernel's PTY buffer would fill and the user's program would block in `write`, freezing a build because a tab was slow or closed. Instead the send position may lag the ring's write position; a slow browser gets output later, and if the lag exceeds the ring, the oldest unsent bytes are overwritten and reported with `output_gap`. On reconnect the client sends, per process, the offset just past its last received byte: if that is still in the ring, the agent replays from it; if not, it sends `output_gap` with the bytes lost and continues from the ring's oldest byte, so the UI shows a marker instead of silently skipping. The alternative, a durable log outside the sandbox, keeps unlimited history and survives a sandbox loss, but every byte crosses the network twice and is stored, for output whose process dies with the sandbox anyway. The ring's price is capped history: about seven minutes at 600 B/s, a few seconds of a verbose build.

Reconnecting needs no lookup: the Gateway dials the host address in the `stream_token`. The host agent accepts only if the token's `sandbox_id` and `generation` match a sandbox it runs under a current lease; otherwise — the workspace moved, or this host was fenced — it refuses, and the client calls `/start` for a fresh token.

**Workspace lifecycle and cost.** "Active" means an open WebSocket or a running foreground process; the host agent reports each change, and a periodic sweep hibernates workspaces whose `idle_since` is over 15 minutes old. That timeout is the largest cost lever: about 15,400 of the 36,000 peak sandboxes are waiting it out, and each minute of it costs $\lambda_{\text{peak}} \times 60 \approx 1{,}030$ sandboxes, about 21 hosts, against users who come back inside the window and find everything still running.

What hibernation keeps is a choice. Filesystem only — sync and detach the volume, release the compute — resumes along the normal 2-second path, but running processes are gone: a dev server restarts, and state held only in memory is lost. A memory snapshot resumes a dev server where it left off, but it is as large as the memory the guest has touched, up to 4 GiB against a 350 MB average volume, so keeping one per hibernated workspace would multiply storage. Choice: filesystem-only by default, since a restart costs seconds, not data; snapshots are a priced opt-in.

A host failure surfaces as an expired lease (the host agent renews with a write conditional on `generation` and `status = attached`). The old host may only be partitioned, and its microVM can keep writing even after its host agent dies, so recovery does not rely on timing. The lease monitor first revokes the lease (`attached → releasing`, only if expired), so no late renewal succeeds. It then fences at the storage: the block store enforces single attachment itself, so the manager force-detaches the volume from the old host, after which the old host's I/O fails. Only once the store confirms does one update mark the row `released`, bump `generation` and move the workspace to `resuming`; if it cannot confirm, the workspace stays unavailable rather than risk two writers. Separately, a host agent that cannot renew stops its sandboxes at its own deadline, counted from when it sent its last successful renewal so that it passes no later than the manager's, and one whose renewal returns `409` stops at once. That protects processes and terminals; the fence protects the bytes.

Where the bytes live decides what a failure loses. On the host's local disk, the workspace is stranded until that host returns, or loses everything since its last upload, and every hibernation or move copies the whole volume. On the network volume, the guest's page cache is the only write-back layer and `fsync` returns only once the store has the data, so a crash loses just unsynced writes, as on a laptop; the price is a network round trip per synchronous write. So the block store is chosen for enforced single attachment with forced detach, attach fast enough for the 2-second path, and thin provisioning.

### Follow-ups

- A second user with *edit* access attaches to the same sandbox and the same PTYs; a *view* token carries `access: "view"`, and the host agent rejects its `run`, `input`, `resize` and `cancel` messages.
- If users instead connect over SSH to a provisioned host, the SSH server supplies the PTY and a terminal multiplexer supplies reattachment; what remains is scheduling work across the host fleet, a separate design.
