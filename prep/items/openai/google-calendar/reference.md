Two points worth confirming before designing: whether a participant must already be a registered user, or an event can be shared with an outside email address (assumed: registered users only — an outside guest would need its own lightweight identity, not covered here); and whether editing "all" occurrences of a series is expected to rewrite ones that already happened (assumed: no, only occurrences that have not started yet change).

### Requirements and scale

**Event storage.** $100{,}000{,}000$ users average $120$ event definitions each in a two-year span, for $1.2\times10^{10}$ rows; $20\%$, $2.4\times10^9$, are recurring series and the rest single occurrences. At roughly 280 bytes a row (title, start/end, the recurrence fields, foreign keys, flags), the event store holds about $1.2\times10^{10}\times280 \approx 3{,}129$ GiB — a few terabytes, well inside a horizontally sharded store.

**Read and write QPS.** $30{,}000{,}000$ daily active users write $2$ times a day on average — create, edit, cancel, or RSVP — for $6\times10^7$ writes/day: about $694$ QPS on average and, at a $5\times$ peak factor for the daily busy window, $3{,}472$ QPS at peak. The same users load $15$ views a day, for $4.5\times10^8$ reads/day: about $5{,}208$ QPS on average and $26{,}042$ at peak — a $7.5$:$1$ read-to-write ratio, which is what makes the read path, not the write path, worth spending complexity on.

**Instance index and write amplification.** The per-user instance index holds a row per occurrence per participant, from 90 days back to 2 years ahead. If a recurring series averages 40 occurrences in two years (an assumption: most are weekly, many end within months), a user's definitions produce $96 + 24\times40 = 1{,}056$ occurrences per two years, $1{,}188$ in the 2.25-year window, each in $2.5$ participants' indexes: $2{,}970$ rows per user, $3\times10^{11}$ in all, about $27$ TiB at 100 bytes a row. That is nearly nine times the event store, so the index sets the shard count; per user it is about $3.6$ rows a day. If one write in five rewrites a series' 40 occurrences ahead, a write averages $(0.8 + 0.2\times40)\times2.5 = 22$ index rows, about $76{,}000$ row writes a second at peak, sent as one batch per participant partition: $2.5$ per request, about $8{,}700$ a second.

**Sync push volume.** Every write needs a "something changed" push to every device of every participant: at $2.5$ participants and $2.5$ devices each, $6.25$ targets per write (a slight over-count, including the writer's own device), $6\times10^7\times6.25 = 3.75\times10^8$ pushes/day: about $4{,}340$ QPS on average and $21{,}701$ at peak. That is close to the view read rate, but a push carries no event data and prompts only a small change-log read.

### Data model and API

**Calendar** — `calendar_id`, `owner_user_id`, `name`, `timezone` (default for new events on it), `created_at`.

**Event** — `event_id`, `calendar_id`, `organizer_user_id`, `title`, `location`, `description`, `all_day` (bool), `start_local`, `end_local` (wall-clock times in `timezone`, like iCalendar's `DTSTART;TZID=...`, so a series keeps its time of day; for an all-day event, `start_date`/`end_date`: calendar dates, no time zone), `timezone` (an IANA zone name, required unless `all_day`), `recurrence` (nullable: `{freq, interval, by_day, by_month_day, by_set_pos, count, until_utc}`), `status` (`confirmed | cancelled`), `version` (optimistic concurrency, bumped by every change to the event or its exceptions), `updated_at` — a single occurrence and a recurring series share this row shape. Events, exceptions and participants are sharded by `calendar_id`.

**EventException** — one row per modified or cancelled occurrence of a series: `event_id`, `original_start_utc` (the base rule's own occurrence time, before any override — iCalendar's `RECURRENCE-ID`), `kind` (`cancelled | modified`; a cancelled one is what iCalendar lists in `EXDATE`), and, when modified, `new_start_utc`, `new_end_utc`, `new_timezone`; `updated_at`.

**Participant** — `event_id`, `user_id`, `role` (`organizer | attendee`), `rsvp_status` (`needs_action | accepted | declined | tentative`), `responded_at` (the device's clock when the user answered); a secondary index on `user_id`.

**Per-user instance index** — `user_id`, `occurrence_start_utc` (for an all-day row, 00:00 UTC of its first date), `occurrence_end_utc`, `event_id`, `event_version`, `calendar_id`, `title`, `all_day`, `is_exception`, `hidden` (set when the user declined), indexed on `(user_id, occurrence_start_utc)`, and on `(user_id, event_id)` for replacing an event's rows.

**Per-user change log** — `user_id`, `seq` (increasing per user), `event_id`, `change_type`, `affected_from_utc`, `affected_to_utc` (the span holding the event's occurrences before and after the change), `occurred_at`, indexed on `(user_id, seq)`.

Core APIs:

- `POST /calendars/{calendar_id}/events` — create a single or recurring event. Body: `{title, start_local, end_local, timezone | start_date, end_date, recurrence?, participants: [user_id]}`. Returns `{event_id, version}`.
- `PATCH /calendars/{calendar_id}/events/{event_id}` — reschedule, edit, or cancel (`status: "cancelled"`). Body: `{scope: "this" | "this_and_following" | "all", original_start?, ...changed fields, version}`; `original_start` is required unless `scope` is `"all"` or the event is not recurring. Returns the new `version`, or `409` with the current copy if `version` is stale.
- `POST /events/{event_id}/rsvp` — Body: `{status: "accepted" | "declined" | "tentative", responded_at}`, for the whole series.
- `GET /users/{user_id}/view?start_date=...&end_date=...&tz=...` — every occurrence overlapping those local dates across the user's own calendars and the invites they have not declined: `{occurrences: [{event_id, version, start, end, all_day, title, calendar_id, is_exception}]}`.
- `GET /users/{user_id}/sync?since=<token>` — `{changes: [{event_id, change_type, affected_from, affected_to}], next_token}`; a token older than the change log's retention returns `{resync_required: true}` instead.

**Writing an event.** A create, reschedule, or RSVP goes client → gateway (auth, then a per-user rate limit) → calendar service, which validates it and commits the `Event` row (with any `EventException`, or only the `Participant` row for an RSVP) under the conditional update from the sync deep dive. The materializer reads the event store's change stream, so a committed write is fanned out even if the service crashes right after it: it re-expands the event's window into every participant's index rows, then appends to each participant's change log and has the push service tickle their devices. In that order, a device that sees the entry and re-reads its view gets the new rows; the stream is processed at least once, and a repeated entry only costs a re-read.

**Reading a view.** A day/week/month/year request goes client → gateway → calendar service, which turns the viewer's local dates into a UTC range and runs one range scan of the instance index on `(user_id, occurrence_start_utc)`; the rows carry everything the view needs, so nothing is read from the event store on this path.

### Deep dives

**Storing and expanding recurring events.** Read-time expansion finds, for each view, every series whose span overlaps the range (an interval index on `(calendar_id, rule_start, rule_end)`) and expands it in application code: a viewer takes part in $24\times2.5 = 60$ series on average, up to about 1.6 million expansions a second at the $26{,}042$ peak, and a series with a `count` must be walked from its own start to know whether the count has run out. Write-time materialization expands a series into rows once, so a view is one range scan whatever the rules, at the cost of write amplification and a job that extends indefinite series.

This design materializes — $76{,}000$ row writes a second at peak, against 1.6 million expansions inside views' latency budgets — but keeps the rule as the only source of truth and materializes only the window from 90 days back to 2 years ahead. A daily job slides the window; a view outside it reads the user's events through the `Participant.user_id` index and expands them for that range. A series with no end date starting now materializes 105 rows if weekly, 730 if daily, 24 if monthly.

The expander follows RFC 5545's `RRULE` semantics for this subset. Weeks start on Monday (its default `WKST`), so "every 2 weeks on Monday and Friday" counts weeks from the one containing the start. A date the month lacks (April 31) yields no occurrence and does not count toward `count`. `by_set_pos` $= n$ picks the $n$-th of the month's dates matching `by_day`, so the last weekday is `by_day` = MO–FR with `by_set_pos` $= -1$. `until` is inclusive, and RFC 5545 forbids `count` and `until` in the same rule. A start date the rule does not generate is not an occurrence (RFC 5545 leaves that case undefined).

Occurrences are generated in the series' local time and then converted to UTC, so a Tuesday 9 a.m. meeting stays at 9 a.m. through a clock change while its UTC instant shifts by an hour. A local time that occurs twice in the fall-back hour means the first of the two, as RFC 5545 specifies. A local time skipped by the spring-forward gap takes the offset from before the gap, so a 2:30 a.m. occurrence happens at 3:30 daylight time: RFC 5545's rule for a single local time, where its recurrence rules would instead drop the occurrence without a trace. Each occurrence lasts the series' exact elapsed duration: a one-hour meeting at 1:30 a.m. on the fall-back day ends at the second 1:30.

An edit to a series names a `scope`, commits in one transaction on the calendar's shard, and bumps the `Event` row's `version`. **This occurrence only** writes one `EventException` keyed by the occurrence's original start, its `RECURRENCE-ID`; a cancelled occurrence still counts toward `count`, since RFC 5545 removes `EXDATE` values after the rule has generated its set. **This and following** ends the old rule just before the edited occurrence (`until_utc` one second before its original start, `count` dropped) and creates a new `Event` row from that occurrence's scheduled local time, with the edited fields, the remaining count (`count` $- k$ after $k$ earlier occurrences, cancelled ones included) and copies of the `Participant` rows; later exceptions move to it if its rule still generates their original start, and the materializer replaces the old event's rows from the split on. **All** is "this and following" at the first occurrence not yet started (in place if none has), so past occurrences keep their rows and their rule.

**Making the four views fast to read.** Every view is one query: a user's occurrences overlapping `[range_start, range_end)`. Keying the index by `user_id` makes that a single scan although the schedule spans the user's own calendars and every event they were invited to; keying it by `calendar_id` would be cheaper to write but would turn every view into several queries plus a merge, since an invited event lives on someone else's calendar. So invites fan out at write time: the estimate's 22 index rows per write, up to 730 per participant for an edit to a daily series. Declining sets `hidden` on that participant's rows instead of deleting them, so re-accepting is a flag flip.

An occurrence that began before the range and is still running (a three-day offsite) is keyed before `range_start`, so the service keeps each user's longest event duration and scans from `range_start` minus it, keeping timed rows whose `[start, end)` overlaps the UTC range and all-day rows whose dates overlap the viewer's local dates. That covers all-day rows too: their key, 00:00 UTC of the first date, is at most 12 hours before the viewer's midnight, and the event lasts at least 24 hours. At 3.6 rows a day, a week view is about 25 rows, a month 110, a year 1,300, each one scan within one partition; a year full of daily series can reach several thousand rows, which the API pages. No cache sits in front of the index: it would save little on a single-partition scan, and a miss that read the old rows could refill it after the materializer's invalidation. The client prefetches the adjacent range instead.

**Keeping devices in sync.** A device holds a `since` token — the last sequence number it consumed from its user's change log — and the sync endpoint returns every entry after it plus a new token. An entry is `(event_id, change_type, affected span)`, not the event: the device re-reads, through the view path, whichever of its cached ranges overlap the span. A push carries only a tickle, "go sync", never a payload: a push can be silently dropped, so correctness cannot depend on it, and the device also syncs on foregrounding and on a slow timer.

Concurrent edits are resolved with the `Event` row's `version`, which every view occurrence carries: a write sends the `version` the device last read, the update is conditioned on it (`UPDATE events SET ..., version = version + 1 WHERE event_id = ? AND version = ?`), and if another device or the organizer wrote first, perhaps while this one was offline, it matches zero rows and returns `409` with the current copy; last-write-wins would silently drop one of the two edits. An RSVP writes only the responder's `Participant` row, never the `Event` row's `version`, so accepting never conflicts with the organizer editing the location; the row keeps the answer with the later `responded_at`, so a stale answer from a device that was offline cannot overwrite a newer one.

The change log keeps 30 days: each of the $6\times10^7$ daily writes lands in $2.5$ participants' logs, so 30 days is $4.5\times10^9$ entries, about 210 GiB at 50 bytes each. An older `since` token gets a resync response and the device re-reads its views, so the log never has to serve an arbitrarily old cursor.

### Follow-ups

- A free/busy lookup across other users, for a scheduling assistant, needs its own lightweight index of busy intervals queryable without exposing an event's title or attendees.
- A meeting-room calendar turns "accept an invite" into "reserve a scarce resource", needing overlap-proof booking (for example one row per room and 15-minute slot, inserted in one transaction only if absent) rather than the per-event version check.
- An RSVP to a single occurrence needs a per-participant exception keyed by `RECURRENCE-ID`, which the materializer overlays on that participant's rows as it overlays an `EventException`.
