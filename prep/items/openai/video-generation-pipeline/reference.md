Worth confirming before designing: whether a run can be snapshotted mid-generation and resumed on another worker. This design assumes it can, at about 3 seconds per snapshot.

### Requirements and scale

**Request rate.** $172{,}800$ requests/day average to $172{,}800 / 86{,}400 = 2$ requests/sec; at 8x that for the daily peak, peak submissions run at $16$ requests/sec.

**Average GPU-seconds per job.** Weighting the per-second GPU cost by the resolution mix,

$$
10 \times 0.50 + 30 \times 0.35 + 80 \times 0.15 = 27.5 \text{ GPU-sec per output-second,}
$$

and at the average requested duration of 6 seconds, a job costs $6 \times 27.5 = 165$ GPU-seconds (about 2.75 minutes) — the $W$ used below.

**Concurrently running jobs.** By Little's law, $L = \lambda \cdot W$: at the average arrival rate, $L_{\text{avg}} = 2 \times 165 = 330$ jobs running at once; at peak, $L_{\text{peak}} = 16 \times 165 = 2{,}640$. One worker runs one job, so $2{,}640$ is also the number of busy workers needed at peak.

**Target pool size.** $2{,}640$ workers leaves no slack for ones booting, draining, or failing a health check; with 20% headroom, $2{,}640 \times 1.2 = 3{,}168$, rounded up to **3,200 workers**, which finish $3{,}200 / 165 \approx 19.4$ jobs/sec — peak arrival runs it at $\approx 82.5\%$ utilization, keeping queueing delay small.

**Backlog during a capacity dip.** At the given floor of $1{,}800$ GPUs, the pool finishes only $10.9$ jobs/sec, a deficit of $\approx 5.1$ jobs/sec against peak arrivals; over the 1,200-second dip that adds $\approx 6{,}100$ jobs. The $\approx 1{,}155$ jobs that were running on the $1{,}400$ reclaimed GPUs ($82.5\%$ of them busy) rejoin the queue too, on average half done, worth $\approx 580$ more average jobs — a backlog of $\approx 6{,}690$ if every request is admitted. Once the pool is back at 3,200 workers, the surplus over peak arrivals is $\approx 3.4$ jobs/sec, so draining takes $\approx 1{,}970$ seconds, **about 33 minutes**, assuming arrivals stay at peak — far past the 30-second target, so it has to surface as an ETA and trigger admission control.

**Storage.** Weighting output size the same way gives $2.275$ MB per output-second, or $\approx 13.65$ MB per average job — about **2.36 TB/day** across 172,800 jobs.

### Data model and API

**Job** — `id`, `user_id`, `idempotency_key`, `prompt_ref` (opaque, already-moderated), `model_version`, `duration_sec`, `resolution`, `priority_tier` (`free | plus | enterprise`), `status` (`queued | running | succeeded | failed | cancelled`), `progress_pct`, `cancel_requested`, `attempt_count`, `max_attempts`, `preemption_count`, `fencing_token` (a per-job counter, bumped by every claim and never reset), `lease` (`{worker_id, lease_expires_at}`, present only while `status = running`), `latest_checkpoint_id`, `result_id`, `failure_reason`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

**Checkpoint** — `id`, `job_id`, `fencing_token`, `storage_uri`, `progress_pct`, `created_at`, `expires_at` (short TTL — superseded or terminal-job checkpoints are reclaimed quickly).

**Result** — `id`, `job_id`, `storage_uri`, `size_bytes`, `checksum`, `created_at`, `expires_at` (a longer TTL for the downloadable artifact).

External API:

- `POST /jobs` — `{prompt_ref, duration_sec, resolution, priority_tier, idempotency_key, callback_url}` → `202 {job_id, status: "queued", queue_eta_seconds}`; a retried submission carrying a seen `idempotency_key` returns the existing job.
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}` — `{status, progress_pct, attempt_count, result_url, failure_reason}`.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/cancel` — a terminal job is left as is; a `queued` job becomes `cancelled` through a compare-and-swap on `status = 'queued'`; a `running` job, including one a claim grabbed first, only gets `cancel_requested` set. Returns the resulting status.
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/result` — once `status = succeeded`, redirects to a short-lived signed URL.

Internal, worker-facing API — every call after `claim` carries the `fencing_token` it was issued; the job store answers `409` when that token isn't the job's current one or the job is no longer `running`:

- `POST /workers/{worker_id}/claim` — returns `{job_id, fencing_token, lease_expires_at, resume_checkpoint_uri}`, or `204` if none available.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/heartbeat` — `{fencing_token}` → `{lease_expires_at, cancel_requested}`.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/progress` — `{fencing_token, progress_pct, eta_seconds}`; no lease effect.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/checkpoint` — `{fencing_token, storage_uri, progress_pct}` → new `Checkpoint` row, and `latest_checkpoint_id` moves to it.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/complete` — `{fencing_token, storage_uri, size_bytes, checksum}` → new `Result`, job `succeeded`.
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/fail` — `{fencing_token, reason, retryable}`; releases the lease and applies the retry/backoff/terminal-failure rule from the checkpointing deep dive.

### Architecture

```

A submission lands at the API service, which validates it and writes a `Job` row to the job store — the one place a job's state is authoritative — before acknowledging the client, since a crash between the two would let the client believe a job exists that the system has no record of. A background dispatcher tails the store's change stream and turns queued jobs into entries in the ready queue, a disposable, rebuildable index. The API does not enqueue the job as it writes the row, because no transaction spans a database and a queue: a crash between those two writes would strand the job, or leave an entry for a job that does not exist. The stream delivers at least once, and a duplicate entry is harmless because only the claim's compare-and-swap assigns the job. A GPU worker asking for work gets a candidate from the ready queue, but only a compare-and-swap against the job's row in the store claims it; the scheduler then hands the worker a 30-second lease (three heartbeat intervals) and a fencing token. The worker generates the video, periodically persisting checkpoints and progress and renewing its lease, then uploads the finished video to object storage and calls `complete`; the status change fans out through the notifier as a webhook or SSE event. Two components run continuously alongside this path rather than per-request: the lease monitor requeues any job whose lease expired without a heartbeat, and the capacity manager watches queue depth and per-provider health, scaling the pool and marking workers `draining` on a reclaim warning.

### Deep dives

**Lease-based scheduling with fencing tokens.** Invariant to protect: at most one attempt's writes can still take effect, even when a partition or long pause makes the scheduler believe a worker is dead while it keeps running.

- *Lease timeout alone*: the scheduler reassigns a job once its lease expires unheard-from. Cheap, but it only bounds how long the *scheduler* waits — nothing stops the *original* worker from finishing late (delayed by the same partition) and writing a completion after a second worker already took the job: split brain. Having the worker check its own lease before writing doesn't close the gap, since a pause can fall between the check and the write.
- *Fencing token on every write* (chosen): the claim's compare-and-swap also increments the job's `fencing_token`, and the new value goes to the worker. Every later worker call carries it and becomes a conditional update, `UPDATE jobs SET ... WHERE id = ? AND fencing_token = ? AND status = 'running'`; zero rows updated means the attempt is stale — superseded by a new claim, or already requeued or cancelled — and the `409` tells the worker to abandon it.

The object store cannot run that check on an upload, so each attempt writes its checkpoints and result under keys containing its token (`{job_id}/{fencing_token}/...`), never overwriting another attempt's objects, and an upload only becomes current when the `checkpoint` or `complete` call commits its URI into the row under the same condition; a fenced-off worker's uploads stay orphans until the TTL removes them. Cost: one extra predicate on a write already keyed by job id. Fencing alone doesn't stop a fenced-off worker's GPU: a worker that can't renew its lease stops when its own lease runs out, and one whose partition heals stops at its first `409`.

Cancellation reuses this machinery. A `running` job's cancel only sets `cancel_requested`, since nothing stops a remote worker on the spot: the worker learns at its next heartbeat (within 10 s), stops, and calls `fail` with `reason: "cancelled"`, which ends the job `cancelled` without touching the retry budget and deletes its checkpoints. If the worker is unreachable, the lease monitor finds the flag when the lease expires and cancels instead of requeueing; a `complete` that lands before the worker sees the flag wins, and the job ends `succeeded`.

**Checkpointing and retries.** A checkpoint trades a pause now for less recomputation after a loss. Over each $T$ seconds of work a checkpoint costs $C$, and an unannounced worker loss (a crash, a reclaim without warning), arriving on average every $\text{MTBF}$ seconds, redoes on average $T/2$; the fraction of GPU time lost is therefore $C/T + T/(2 \cdot \text{MTBF})$, smallest at $T^* = \sqrt{2 C \cdot \text{MTBF}}$ (Young's approximation). It assumes losses form a Poisson process (a constant hazard, whatever a job has already done) with $C \ll \text{MTBF}$, so two losses within one interval are negligible; a restart cost $R$ adds about $R/\text{MTBF}$ to the loss but does not move $T^*$. A provider-wide outage is a burst rather than a rate, which is why $\text{MTBF}$ below comes from a volatile period.

With $C = 3$ s and $\text{MTBF} = 900$ s, $T^* = \sqrt{2 \times 3 \times 900} \approx 73$ s — call it 75 s. The loss there is under 9%, and the minimum is flat: 50 s or 100 s would cost less than one percentage point more. At worst a crash lands just before a checkpoint commits and redoes $T + C = 78$ s, inside the 90-second target.

Each job carries `attempt_count` and `max_attempts = 4`; a retryable `fail` other than a preemption, or a lease expiry, increments it, a non-retryable one (an input the model rejects) ends the job at once, and reaching the cap moves the job to terminal `failed` — `failure_reason` set, user notified — instead of back to `queued`. A requeued job waits out an exponential backoff (base 5 s, factor 2, cap 60 s, jitter) before it can be claimed again. That isn't to protect the pool — workers pull one job at a time, so the queue absorbs a mass requeue — but to slow a job that crashes every worker it lands on (a poison input, running out of GPU memory).

*Preemption* with notice (tens of seconds): the capacity manager marks the worker `draining`, the worker takes an out-of-band checkpoint and fails with `reason: "preempted"`, and the job is requeued at once — outside the retry budget, but counted in a separately capped `preemption_count`, so a job that keeps getting reclaimed is eventually pinned to steadier, non-preemptible capacity. A *crash*, or a reclaim with no warning, which looks the same, is noticed only at lease expiry, up to 30 s later; it redoes at most one interval and does consume the retry budget, since without extra signal it can't be told apart from a job-specific failure. The detection delay postpones the retry but costs no GPU work — the lost GPU is gone either way.

**Capacity volatility and priority scheduling.** The pool spans several cloud providers and regions; the capacity manager tracks per-provider counts and requests replacement capacity elsewhere when one shrinks, so the scheduler sees the *aggregate* pool. Jobs on reclaimed instances are displaced no matter what; the choice is which *other* running jobs yield when a higher-tier job has waited past its tier's target (say 30 s for `enterprise`) — the case where waiting for the next GPU to free up isn't enough:

- *Oldest-first*: preempt whichever attempt has run longest. Simple, but it ignores tier, and the oldest attempt is often the closest to finishing — about to free its GPU anyway.
- *Priority tier, then least progress* (chosen): rank running attempts by `priority_tier`, then `progress_pct`, and preempt from the front, only jobs of a lower tier than the one waiting — a fresh `free` job yields before a nearly done `plus` one, and an `enterprise` job never yields. The yielding job checkpoints out of band first, so little is redone, and one whose `preemption_count` has hit its cap is skipped, so no job is bounced forever. Cost: a live index on `(priority_tier, progress_pct)`, and a checkpoint plus a reload for every job moved.

A single FIFO queue lets one tier crowd out the others and, when the pool mixes GPU types, lets a job at its head that needs a type the asking worker lacks block the compatible jobs behind it. The ready queue is instead partitioned by `(priority_tier, gpu_class)` and pulled with weighted round-robin (`enterprise : plus : free` roughly `6 : 3 : 1`), skipping empty partitions. That share is the guarantee against starvation: while `free` has queued work it gets at least a tenth of dispatches however heavy paid traffic is. Tier is not the only input: within a partition the scheduler rotates between users instead of following submission time strictly, so one account queueing 500 jobs cannot push a same-tier account behind all of them, and inside one user submission order holds, so a job only moves forward as it waits. A job requeued after a preemption rejoins at the front of its user's jobs, so yielding a GPU does not also cost it its place in line.

At submission the API computes the job's ETA: GPU-seconds queued ahead of it in its partition, divided by the GPU-seconds per second that partition received over the last minute. `free`-tier submissions with an ETA over 10 minutes get `429` instead of an indefinite queue; paid tiers are always accepted and shown their ETA, which stays bounded as long as paid arrivals alone fit within the shrunken pool.

Preemption's own cost is invisible in a job's latency, so it is measured separately: GPU-seconds redone after a preemption as a share of GPU-seconds spent, preemptions per running job per hour by tier, how many jobs reached their `preemption_count` cap, and each partition's share of dispatches — the last is the starvation alarm: `free` with queued work and under a tenth of dispatches means the weighted round-robin is being bypassed.

### Follow-ups

- Moderating the finished video adds a condition to the download: the check runs on the `complete` path and records its verdict on the `Result` row, and `GET /jobs/{job_id}/result` signs a URL only for a job that is both `succeeded` and cleared.
- A worker whose `complete` call times out retries it, though the first call may already have gone through: the row keeps the token after success, so a `complete` whose token matches an already `succeeded` job returns success instead of `409`.
