Two points worth confirming with the interviewer before coding: what `get` returns when nothing matches (here `None` rather than an empty string, since a value need not be a string); and whether "strictly increasing" holds per key or globally (here per key, since unrelated keys have no reason to block each other's writes).

### Part 1

Each key maps to two parallel lists kept in increasing order of timestamp: `_timestamps` and `_values`. `set` uses `bisect_left` to find where `timestamp` belongs — if an entry already sits there, it is overwritten (the later call wins); otherwise a new entry is inserted at that position, which is how a timestamp arriving late still lands in the right place. `get` uses `bisect_right`, not `bisect_left`: with an exact match at `timestamp`, `get` must still include it, so the answer sits at index `i - 1`, one before where `bisect_right` would insert a value equal to `timestamp`.

```python
import bisect
from typing import Any


class TimeMap:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._timestamps: dict[str, list[float]] = {}
        self._values: dict[str, list[Any]] = {}

    def set(self, key: str, value: Any, timestamp: float) -> None:
        timestamps = self._timestamps.setdefault(key, [])
        values = self._values.setdefault(key, [])
        i = bisect.bisect_left(timestamps, timestamp)
        if i < len(timestamps) and timestamps[i] == timestamp:
            values[i] = value               # NOTE: same timestamp as an existing entry -- the later call wins
        else:
            timestamps.insert(i, timestamp)
            values.insert(i, value)

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: float) -> Any | None:
        timestamps = self._timestamps.get(key)
        if not timestamps:
            return None
        i = bisect.bisect_right(timestamps, timestamp)  # NOTE: not bisect_left -- an exact match still counts
        return self._values[key][i - 1] if i > 0 else None
```

`get` is $O(\log n)$ in the number of values recorded for `key`; `set` is $O(n)$ because `timestamps.insert` and `values.insert` both shift the tail of the list.

```python
tm = TimeMap()
tm.set("probe-1", 68.0, 100.0)
tm.set("probe-1", 71.5, 140.0)
assert (tm.get("probe-1", 130.0), tm.get("probe-1", 90.0), tm.get("probe-2", 140.0)) == (68.0, None, None)
tm.set("probe-1", 65.0, 120.0)
assert tm.get("probe-1", 130.0) == 65.0
tm.set("probe-1", 70.0, 140.0)
assert tm.get("probe-1", 140.0) == 70.0
```

### Part 2

`set`/`get` reach for the clock exactly when `timestamp` is `None`; an explicit `timestamp` of `0` or `0.0` is a real value, not "missing", which is why the check is `is None` and not a falsiness check. From here on, each part *subclasses* the previous one under the same name `TimeMap`, overriding only what changes and delegating to `super()` for the rest, so Part 1's `bisect` logic is written once and reused, not repeated.

```python
import time


class RealClock:
    def now(self) -> float:
        return time.time()


class TimeMap(TimeMap):
    def __init__(self, clock: Any = None) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self._clock = clock if clock is not None else RealClock()

    def set(self, key: str, value: Any, timestamp: float | None = None) -> None:
        super().set(key, value, self._clock.now() if timestamp is None else timestamp)

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: float | None = None) -> Any | None:
        return super().get(key, self._clock.now() if timestamp is None else timestamp)
```

```python
clock = ManualClock(start=1000.0)
tm = TimeMap(clock=clock)
tm.set("probe-1", 68.0)
clock.advance(40.0)
tm.set("probe-1", 71.5)
assert tm.get("probe-1") == 71.5
assert tm.get("probe-1", 1000.0) == 68.0
```

### Part 3

Once every recorded timestamp for a key is guaranteed larger than the one before it, `set` no longer needs `bisect_left` plus `list.insert` — the new entry is always the last one, so a plain `append` is enough, turning the per-call cost from $O(n)$ into $O(1)$ amortized. `get` needs no change: the inherited one still works, because the two lists stay sorted.

Rejecting a non-increasing timestamp with an exception instead would keep every recorded timestamp a genuine clock reading, but leave the retry-or-drop decision to the caller. The `last(key) + 1` rule never rejects a write, but the 1 is one unit of whatever the clock counts, a whole second with `time.time()`. After the clock moves back, a key written more than once per unit is nudged on every write and runs ever further ahead of the clock instead of catching up, and a `get` that omits `timestamp` queries at `clock.now()`, so it misses those writes until the clock catches up. Counting in the clock's finest unit (integer nanoseconds from `time.time_ns()`) makes each nudge negligible, so the clock does catch up.

```python
class TimeMap(TimeMap):
    def __init__(self, clock: Any = None) -> None:
        super().__init__(clock)
        self._last: dict[str, float] = {}

    def set(self, key: str, value: Any, timestamp: float | None = None) -> float:
        if timestamp is None:
            timestamp = self._clock.now()
        last = self._last.get(key)
        if last is not None and timestamp <= last:  # NOTE: a backward clock and a stale explicit timestamp
            timestamp = last + 1                     #      both land here
        self._timestamps.setdefault(key, []).append(timestamp)  # NOTE: append -- timestamp now exceeds all earlier
        self._values.setdefault(key, []).append(value)
        self._last[key] = timestamp
        return timestamp
```

```python
clock = ManualClock(start=100.0)
tm = TimeMap(clock=clock)
assert tm.set("probe-1", 68.0) == 100.0
assert tm.set("probe-1", 70.0, 100.0) == 101.0
assert tm.get("probe-1", 100.0) == 68.0
assert tm.get("probe-1", 101.0) == 70.0
clock.advance(-50.0)
assert tm.set("probe-1", 65.0) == 102.0
assert tm.get("probe-1", 102.0) == 65.0
```

### Part 4

Making `set` thread-safe means locking the *whole* read-modify-write sequence — read `last(key)`, decide whether to nudge, append, update `last(key)` — not just the individual dictionary or list calls inside it: CPython's GIL never interrupts a single bytecode, but it can switch threads between any two of them, and "read `last`, then write it back" leaves exactly such a gap: two threads that both read `last(key)` as 100.0, each with a clock reading of 100.0, both record 101.0.

Both locking strategies subclass Part 3's `TimeMap` again and only wrap `super().set` and `super().get` in a lock, so what is protected is the sequence already written in Part 3, and `clock.now()` is read inside the lock too. Read before waiting for the lock, a call that read the clock first could reach the lock second, and would then be nudged to `last(key) + 1` although the clock never moved back. The simpler strategy, `GlobalLockTimeMap`, uses one `threading.Lock` for the whole store, which makes an update to `"probe-1"` wait behind an unrelated update to `"probe-2"`.

Giving each key its own lock removes that, but creating a key's lock is itself a read-modify-write ("is there one already? if not, make one"), so it needs a small lock of its own, held only while it is created or looked up. The attributes inherited from `TimeMap` stay shared without a lock of their own: a single `dict.get`/`setdefault` call cannot be interrupted mid-call, only a sequence of several such calls can, and the per-key lock is exactly what protects that sequence.

```python
import threading


class PerKeyLockTimeMap(TimeMap):
    def __init__(self, clock: Any = None) -> None:
        super().__init__(clock)
        self._key_locks: dict[str, threading.Lock] = {}
        self._registry_lock = threading.Lock()

    def _lock_for(self, key: str) -> threading.Lock:
        with self._registry_lock:  # NOTE: guards only the creation of a key's lock, not the operation under it
            lock = self._key_locks.get(key)
            if lock is None:
                lock = threading.Lock()
                self._key_locks[key] = lock
        return lock

    def set(self, key: str, value: Any, timestamp: float | None = None) -> float:
        with self._lock_for(key):  # NOTE: a missing timestamp is read from the clock in here, by Part 3's set
            return super().set(key, value, timestamp)

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: float | None = None) -> Any | None:
        with self._lock_for(key):  # NOTE: get needs it too -- set appends the timestamp before the value
            return super().get(key, timestamp)


ThreadSafeTimeMap = PerKeyLockTimeMap
```

- : one global lock · different keys: block each other · same key, several `get`: block each other · building the lock: nothing to build
- : one lock per key · different keys: run independently · same key, several `get`: block each other · building the lock: needs its own lock
- : read/write lock per key · different keys: run independently · same key, several `get`: run together · building the lock: stdlib has none to build on

A read/write lock would let several `get` calls on one key hold the lock together, but each holds it only for an $O(\log n)$ bisect, and under the GIL two threads never execute bytecode at the same instant anyway, so a correct one (the standard library ships none) would only add code and overhead. It pays off when the locked section does work that can overlap, such as I/O, or on an interpreter without a GIL.

```python
tm = ThreadSafeTimeMap(clock=ManualClock(start=1040.0))
threads = [threading.Thread(target=tm.set, args=("probe-1", v)) for v in (71.5, 69.0)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()
assert {tm.get("probe-1", 1040.0), tm.get("probe-1", 1041.0)} == {71.5, 69.0}
```

### Follow-ups

- Answering `get(key, t1, t2)` for a whole range needs two bisects to locate both ends, not a fresh scan of the key's whole history.
- To survive a restart, append every write to a log, with the timestamp it was actually recorded at, before applying it in memory, and replay the log on startup.
- Across machines, no clock is exactly synchronized; a hybrid logical clock keeps the largest physical time seen so far plus a separate counter for ties, so it orders causally related events correctly and, unlike the `+1` nudge, never runs ahead of the fastest physical clock.

`GlobalLockTimeMap`, the single-lock strategy of Part 4, in full: every call wrapped in one shared lock.

```python
import threading


class GlobalLockTimeMap(TimeMap):
    def __init__(self, clock: Any = None) -> None:
        super().__init__(clock)
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

    def set(self, key: str, value: Any, timestamp: float | None = None) -> float:
        with self._lock:
            return super().set(key, value, timestamp)

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: float | None = None) -> Any | None:
        with self._lock:
            return super().get(key, timestamp)
```

An independent reading of the statement, built without calling anything from `TimeMap`: every `set` call is kept, in call order, in one list per key; with `nudge` on, `set` applies Part 3's rule, taking `last(key)` as the largest timestamp in that list, and `get` scans the list for the largest timestamp at or below the query, the later call winning a tie. It is compared with Part 2's class and with the three classes that follow Part 3's rule.

```python
import random
from collections import Counter


class NaiveTimeMap:
    def __init__(self, clock: Any, nudge: bool) -> None:
        self.entries: dict[str, list[tuple[float, Any]]] = {}   # every set call, in call order
        self.clock, self.nudge = clock, nudge

        if self.nudge and earlier and timestamp <= max(earlier):
            timestamp = max(earlier) + 1
        self.entries.setdefault(key, []).append((timestamp, value))
        return timestamp

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: float | None = None) -> Any | None:
        if timestamp is None:
            timestamp = self.clock.now()
        best = None
        for t, v in self.entries.get(key, []):
            if t <= timestamp and (best is None or t >= best[0]):   # >=: the later of two equal timestamps wins
                best = (t, v)
        return best[1] if best is not None else None

A thread switch forced into every read-modify-write gap, instead of waiting for the scheduler to land in one: `time.sleep(0)` releases the GIL, so after `YieldingDict.get` or `setdefault` has read, another thread runs before the caller uses what it read. Part 3's `TimeMap`, and a per-key-lock variant whose lock registry is not guarded, break a guarantee in almost every trial (a repeated timestamp, or a `get` that finds a timestamp whose value is not appended yet and raises `IndexError`); the two locked classes never do.

```python
import sys


class YieldingDict(dict):
    def get(self, key, default=None):
        found = super().get(key, default)
        time.sleep(0)   # releases the GIL: another thread runs before the caller acts on `found`
        return found

```

A stress test with unforced scheduling: `sys.setswitchinterval(1e-6)` makes a waiting thread force a switch after 1 µs instead of 5 ms, so the threads really interleave. `TickingClock` never repeats or goes back, so a store that reads it at the instant each call takes effect never nudges; a recorded timestamp that is not one of its readings means a call acted on a stale reading, such as one taken before waiting for the lock. How often unforced scheduling hits a gap depends on how busy the machine is, so this test only asserts that the two locked classes pass; the forced version above is what shows a missing lock is caught.
