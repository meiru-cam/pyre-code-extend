Two points worth confirming before designing: the completion API's context-window limit, and whether the login session should survive a page refresh. This design assumes an 8,000-token window, shared by the system prompt, the history and the reply, and that the session survives refresh: the "refresh clears state" rule covers only the conversation in JS memory, while the session lives in a cookie.

### Requirements and scale

**Peak message rate.** $225{,}000$ conversations/day $\times\ 8$ turns/conversation $= 1.8\times10^6$ user messages/day, averaging $1.8\times10^6 / 86{,}400 \approx 20.8$ messages/sec. At 5x, the busiest hour sees about $104$ messages/sec, roughly a fifth of the day's messages.

**Peak concurrent streams.** A reply streams for $300 / 40 = 7.5$ seconds on average. By Little's law, $L = \lambda W$: concurrent streaming replies at peak $\approx 104 \times 7.5 \approx 781$ — the long-lived connections the backend's chat proxy must hold open at once, each with its own upstream call.

**Egress bandwidth.** A frame carrying one 4-character token (an `event: delta` line plus a `data:` line) is 37 bytes: $40 \times 37 = 1{,}480$ B/s per stream, so 781 streams peak at about $1.16$ MB/s, roughly 9 Mbit/s. Even if per-write TLS and TCP headers doubled that, the number to size for is open connections, not bytes.

**Browser memory per conversation.** 8 turns $\times$ (80-token user message + 300-token reply) $\times$ 4 chars/token $\approx 12{,}200$ characters, about 12 KB at the one byte per character V8 uses for Latin-1 text (two once CJK or emoji appear). Add about 120 bytes of bookkeeping per message $\times$ 16 messages $\approx 1.9$ KB: about 14 KB per conversation, bounded by device RAM, not a quota. For comparison, `sessionStorage` (the persistence option in the follow-ups) allows about 5 MiB per origin; even at two bytes per character that is about 186 such conversations, so a quota binds only an unusually long, code-heavy conversation.

### Data model and API

**Conversation** (browser only) — `id` (`crypto.randomUUID()`, created when the first message is sent), `messages` (an ordered array of `Message`).

**Message** (browser only) — `id` (`crypto.randomUUID()`, assigned client-side at creation), `role` (`user | assistant`; the system prompt belongs to the backend), `content`, `status` (`sending | streaming | done | error`), `createdAt` (client clock, epoch ms).

**Session** (backend session store) — `sessionId` (128 random bits, the session cookie's value), `userId`, `expiresAt` (sliding, about a day). **User** (accounts store) — `userId`, `email`, `passwordHash` (a slow salted hash such as Argon2id or bcrypt). Neither holds message content.

Because the backend keeps nothing between requests, every send carries its own context. The backend prepends its own system prompt (under 400 tokens; never one from the client, which could rewrite it) and caps the reply at 800 tokens, leaving $8{,}000 - 400 - 800 = 6{,}800$ tokens of history. The client sends every turn whose reply finished (`done`) plus the new user message, estimating tokens as `content.length / 4` and walking back from the newest turn, keeping whole (user, assistant) turns while the total fits: the oldest turns are dropped first, and the new message is always kept. An average 8-turn conversation (about 3,040 tokens) is never truncated; one that reaches its 19th turn starts losing its oldest. Four characters per token is a rough rate for English that undercounts other scripts, so the backend re-counts with the model's tokenizer and trims further from the oldest turn, returning `400` without calling the model if the new message alone does not fit.

**Core APIs**

- `POST /api/auth/login` — body `{email, password}`, checked against `passwordHash`. On success, creates a session, sets the session cookie (credential deep dive) and returns `{userId}`; no token appears in the response body.
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — deletes the session and clears the cookie; the page also drops its in-memory conversation.
- `POST /api/chat/completions` — body `{conversationId, messages}` (the truncated context above, oldest first); requires the session cookie and a matching CSRF header. Response: a `text/event-stream` body of `event: delta` / `data: {"text": "…"}` frames, then one `event: done` / `data: {"finishReason": "stop" | "length" | "error"}`.
- Cancel — the client calls `AbortController.abort()` on the in-flight `fetch`; there is no separate endpoint. The backend sees the client disconnect and aborts its own upstream call, which stops generation.

### Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph browser["Browser"]
        ui[Chat UI]
        state[(Conversation state<br/>in JS memory)]
    end
    backend[Backend: auth + chat proxy]
    userdb[(User accounts)]
    sessions[(Session store)]
    model[Chat completion API]

    ui --> state
    ui -- login --> backend
    backend --> userdb
    backend --> sessions
    ui -- "send message" --> backend
    backend -- "system prompt + truncated context" --> model
    model -- "token deltas" --> backend
    backend -- "relayed deltas" --> ui
```

Signing in posts credentials to the backend, which checks the accounts store, writes a session and sets the session cookie. For each message, the UI appends the user message (`status: "sending"`) and an empty assistant placeholder (`status: "streaming"`) to the in-memory conversation and posts the truncated `messages` to the chat proxy. The backend looks the session cookie up in the session store, checks the CSRF header against the CSRF cookie, prepends the system prompt, attaches the completion API's key (which the browser never holds), and forwards the request. Each upstream delta goes back as an `event: delta` frame and is appended to the placeholder only; the final `event: done` sets its status to `"done"` (`stop` or `length`) or `"error"`. Nothing on this path is written to disk, so once the response ends the backend holds no trace of the exchange.

### Deep dives

**Streaming rendering.** A WebSocket's second direction buys nothing when each turn is one request and one streamed reply, and `EventSource` only issues a `GET` with no body and no custom headers, so it cannot carry the `messages` array or the CSRF header. The client uses `fetch` with a `POST` body and an `AbortController` signal, reads `response.body.getReader()`, and parses the frames by hand, carrying a cut-off event over to the next read. A read can also end in the middle of a multi-byte UTF-8 character (any CJK character or emoji), so a single `TextDecoder` decodes every chunk with `decode(chunk, {stream: true})`, which holds the incomplete bytes back for the next call; decoding each chunk on its own turns them into `U+FFFD` replacement characters.

Messages render as a list keyed by `message.id`, so the framework matches each item to its existing DOM, and each item is memoized on its `message` object. An update replaces only the streaming message's object, so the other 15 messages of an 8-turn conversation skip rendering; the key alone would not do this, since without memoization a parent's state change re-renders every child. Deltas go into a buffer flushed once per `requestAnimationFrame`, so there is at most one render per displayed frame; because `requestAnimationFrame` does not run in a background tab, the `done` handler flushes the buffer itself.

The text is Markdown, re-parsed on each flush, and mid-stream it is often incomplete. CommonMark already treats an unclosed ` ``` ` fence as a code block running to the end of the text, so a half-arrived code block renders correctly as it grows. What misrenders is inline syntax: an unmatched `**` or a half-arrived link shows as literal characters, then jumps to formatting once its closer arrives. So before each parse the renderer closes unmatched inline markers on a copy of the text; the real closer takes over when it arrives.

For autoscroll, the `scroll` handler records whether the viewport is near the bottom (`scrollHeight - scrollTop - clientHeight <= threshold`), and each flush scrolls down only if it is. Growing content fires no `scroll` event, so only the user scrolling up clears the flag; scrolling back down or sending a message sets it again.

**Login and credentials.** The completion API's key stays in the backend's secrets store; the question is where the browser keeps proof of login. `localStorage` is ruled out: an injected script reads it with one `getItem` call and can send it anywhere. An in-memory access token is just as readable by script while it lives, and is lost on refresh, so it needs a refresh credential in a cookie anyway. The design uses one cookie holding the opaque `sessionId`, set `HttpOnly` (no script, the page's own included, can read it), `Secure` (sent only over HTTPS) and `SameSite=Lax`.

`HttpOnly` is not an XSS defense. An injected script cannot read the cookie, but it can call `fetch` from the page, which attaches it, and can read the CSRF cookie below and the whole conversation; `HttpOnly` only stops it carrying the session off for use elsewhere. XSS itself must be prevented: the Markdown renderer treats model output as untrusted (raw HTML disabled, `javascript:` links rejected), and a Content Security Policy (`script-src 'self'`) refuses inline and third-party scripts.

CSRF is a different attack: another site makes the victim's browser send a request that carries the cookie. `SameSite=Lax` keeps the cookie off cross-site `POST`s (as `Strict` does), but "site" means the registrable domain, so a form on a sibling subdomain still gets it. The real guard is a double-submit token: when the page is first served, the backend sets a second, non-`HttpOnly` cookie with a random value (rotated at login), and every state-changing request (login, logout, completions) must copy it into an `X-CSRF-Token` header, which the backend compares with the cookie. Another origin cannot read that cookie, an HTML form cannot set headers, and a cross-origin `fetch` with a custom header needs a CORS preflight the backend never grants. CORS alone is not the defense: it governs reading responses and non-simple requests, and a plain form `POST` is sent without asking.

The session store costs one key-value lookup per request and makes logout immediate; a self-contained signed token would skip the lookup but could not be revoked before it expires without a blocklist.

**Error handling and retry.** Four failure modes: the connection drops or stalls mid-stream; the completion API refuses with `429` or `503`, which the backend relays before any frame; the session expires (`401`); the device goes offline. A lost network can show up as silence rather than an error, so the backend writes an SSE comment line (`: ping`) every 5 seconds while it waits on the model, and the client aborts the `fetch` after 15 seconds with no bytes, treating that as a drop.

A `429` or `503`, or a drop before the first delta, is retried automatically, since nothing has been shown and the rebuilt request is identical: up to three retries at about 0.5, 1 and 2 seconds with random jitter (or after `Retry-After`, when present), then an error with a retry button. Once deltas have rendered, a drop or a `finishReason: "error"` is not retried silently, because a retry would replace visible text with a different sample: the message keeps its partial content, flips to `"error"`, and offers regenerate, which reissues the request from scratch. Resuming is impossible, since the backend holds nothing (rule 1) and the completion API only answers a message list with a fresh reply; a regeneration pays for the whole reply's output tokens again.

A `401` opens an in-page sign-in dialog rather than redirecting, because navigating to a separate login page would unload the page and discard the conversation; the pending request is resent once the new cookie is set. While the browser reports being offline (the `offline` event), a banner replaces send instead of a retry loop.

A retry must not duplicate the user's message, and a stateless backend has nothing to deduplicate against, so the guarantee is client-side only. The user message and its placeholder each get a `crypto.randomUUID()` id once, when appended; every retry rebuilds the request from `Conversation.messages`, where the user message appears once, and streams into the same placeholder id, so neither the transcript nor the context sent to the model gains a second copy. The ids cannot prevent a second completion call: each retry is a separately billed generation that resends the whole context, on top of whatever the failed attempt generated, which is why automatic retries are capped.

### Follow-ups

- The production metrics are time to first token (send to first `delta` frame, measured in the browser so it includes the user's network) and the share of replies ending in `"error"`, by region and network type.
- Server-persisted history would add a `Conversation`/`Message` store keyed by user and an endpoint to list and resume past conversations; deduplication could then move to the server, keyed by the message id.
- If rule 2 were relaxed, mirroring `Conversation` into `sessionStorage` on every update would keep it across a same-tab refresh while a new tab still starts empty, well within the quota estimated above.
- A per-user token bucket in the chat proxy, not the client's backoff (which a script can skip), is what protects the completion API's quota and cost.
