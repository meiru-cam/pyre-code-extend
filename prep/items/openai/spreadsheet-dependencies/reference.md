Worth confirming first: whether formulas may use multiplication, division or ranges (assumed not here, to keep the parser under twenty lines), and whether a malformed cell name should fail immediately or only once it is actually read (assumed immediately, in both `set` and `get`).

### Part 1

`_FORMULA_RE` encodes the whole grammar — a term, then any number of `[+-]term` blocks — in one pattern, so a single `fullmatch` both validates a formula and rejects a leading operator, two terms in a row, and a trailing operator; `_SIGNED_TERM_RE` then splits an already-valid formula into its signed terms. `get` walks the formula tree recursively, with a `visiting` set catching a path back into a cell still being evaluated, the same idea as DFS cycle detection in a directed graph. A memo persisted across separate `get` calls would go stale the moment a cell it read is `set` again, since Part 1 keeps no record of who depends on whom; a `memo` local to one call needs no invalidation and still gives $O(N)$ time for $N$ cells, since a shared sub-cell is evaluated once per call rather than once per path. The price is recursion depth: three Python frames per cell of the longest chain, so a chain of about 330 cells exhausts the default limit of 1000.

            visiting.discard(name)  # NOTE: visiting is the current path; finished cells answer from memo
        memo[name] = result
        return result
```

### Part 2

Two maps replace the recursion: `dependencies[name]` is what `name`'s formula reads, `dependents[name]` is who reads `name`. A formula referencing `refs` creates a cycle exactly when some cell in `refs` is `name` itself or already transitively depends on `name` — i.e. `name` can reach it by walking `dependents` forward. One traversal from `name` over `dependents`, run *before* touching anything, answers that (is any of `refs` in the reached set?) and also gives `affected`: exactly the cells to recompute, since that set depends only on who reads `name`, untouched by this call. Because the check runs before any mutation, rejecting means simply not proceeding; committing first and rolling back on a detected cycle would have to restore the cell's *previous* formula, not just erase it — easy to get wrong for a cell that already existed. Once accepted, `affected` is recomputed in topological order, so a diamond-shaped dependency is visited once, not once per path into it.

```python
from collections import deque


class Spreadsheet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.contents = {}
        self.cache = {}
        self.dependencies = {}   # cell -> set of cells it reads
        self.dependents = {}     # cell -> set of cells that read it

    def set(self, name, value):
        _check_name(name)
        new_refs = _referenced_cells(value)  # raises FormulaError; touches nothing yet
        affected = self._affected(name)      # everyone that (transitively) reads `name`, incl. itself
        if new_refs & affected:
            raise CycleError(f"{name} = {value!r} would close a cycle")
        # NOTE: nothing above was mutated, so a rejected set needs no rollback.

        for old in self.dependencies.get(name, ()):  # NOTE: drop old edges first -- otherwise a formula
            self.dependents[old].discard(name)         #       that no longer reads X would still recompute on X
        self.dependencies[name] = new_refs
        for r in new_refs:
            self.dependents.setdefault(r, set()).add(name)
        self.contents[name] = value
        for cell in self._topological_order(affected):
            self._recompute_one(cell)

    def get(self, name):
        _check_name(name)
        return self.cache.get(name, 0)

    def _affected(self, name):
        """name plus everything reachable from it by following `dependents` (who reads whom)."""
        affected, stack = {name}, [name]
        while stack:
            cell = stack.pop()
            for dep in self.dependents.get(cell, ()):
                if dep not in affected:
                    affected.add(dep)
                    stack.append(dep)
        return affected

    def _topological_order(self, affected):
        indegree = {c: sum(d in affected for d in self.dependencies.get(c, ())) for c in affected}
        queue = deque(c for c in affected if not indegree[c])
        order = []
        while queue:
            c = queue.popleft()
            order.append(c)
            for dep in self.dependents.get(c, ()):
                if dep in affected:
                    indegree[dep] -= 1
                    if not indegree[dep]:
                        queue.append(dep)
        return order

    def _recompute_one(self, cell):
        value = self.contents.get(cell)
        self.cache[cell] = 0 if value is None else _eval_terms(
            value, lambda c: self.cache.get(c, 0))
```

`get` is a name check plus one dict lookup: a few hundred nanoseconds, the same on a sheet of two cells as on one of 20000. `set` takes time linear in the number of affected cells plus the length of their formulas (and of `name`'s old one), since every dependency edge it follows is a term of one of those formulas: several microseconds per cell of a long chain, however many cells lie outside it.

### Part 3

The first three fall out of the pieces above: dropping old edges is the loop right after the cycle check in `set`; a never-`set` cell reads as `0` through `.get(name, 0)`, and setting it later finds its readers in `dependents` like any other `set`; `LazySpreadsheet` keeps no graph, so it finds a cycle only by recursing into one. The diamond is what the topological order is for: `_affected` collects each cell once and `_topological_order` emits each once, so no cell is recomputed twice in one `set`. The last point is the same code path seen from the other side: `set` reads `self.dependencies.get(name, ())` before writing anything, which is simply empty the first time `name` holds a formula, so adding edges for a literal-to-formula change and dropping edges for the reverse are the same four lines, not two separate cases to keep in sync.

### Follow-ups

- A range such as `SUM(A1:A100)` would add a dependency edge to every cell it covers; the hard part is updating that edge set when rows are inserted or deleted, not evaluating the sum itself.
- A batched `set_many` must check for cycles with all of its new edges in place, since two writes can close a cycle together (`X1 = "=Y1"`, `Y1 = "=X1"`); one Kahn topological sort over the union of the affected cells both detects that and gives the recompute order, so $B$ writes touching $K$ cells cost $O(K)$, not $O(B \cdot K)$.
- Eager recomputation pays for every `set`, even one nobody reads again; a sheet written far more often than it is read favors marking dependents merely "dirty" and recomputing only on the next `get`.
