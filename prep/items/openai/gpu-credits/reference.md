Two rules are worth confirming before coding, because reasonable ledgers differ on them: what `get_balance` returns when no grant is valid (here `0`; `None` is reserved for a negative $v$), and what happens to an overdraft (here it becomes debt, which later grants repay for good). Also ask whether calls are guaranteed to arrive in timestamp order: if they are, Part 1 is already the final answer.

### Part 1

Keep the currently valid grants in a min-heap keyed by `timestamp + expiration`, so the one that expires soonest is always on top, together with `total`, the sum of what the heap holds, and the running `debt`. `add_credit` first pays down `debt`, then pushes whatever amount is left. `subtract`, at its own timestamp, first discards anything from the heap that has already expired, then drains the top of the heap repeatedly until the requested amount is covered or the heap is empty, adding whatever is left over to `debt`. `get_balance` discards expired grants the same way and returns `total - debt`, or `None` when that is negative. Debt only arises once the heap is empty, and a new grant is pushed only after the debt is cleared, so `None` means exactly `debt > 0`.

Parts 2 and 3 replay events through the same logic, so it lives in a small state class that takes each event as a tuple; the ledger of Part 1 is a thin wrapper around it:

```python
import heapq


class _LedgerState:
    """The ledger right after replaying some events in increasing order of timestamp."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.active = []    # heap of [expire_at, remaining]; the earliest-expiring grant is on top
        self.total = 0      # sum of remaining over self.active
        self.debt = 0

    def _drop_expired(self, ts):
        while self.active and self.active[0][0] < ts:     # NOTE: '<', not '<=' -- expiration is inclusive
            self.total -= heapq.heappop(self.active)[1]

    def apply(self, ts, event):
        """Applies one event as of its own timestamp ts."""
        if event[0] == "add":
            _, _credit_id, amount, expire_at = event
            paid = min(self.debt, amount)     # NOTE: a new grant repays outstanding debt before it can be spent
            self.debt -= paid
            if amount > paid:
                heapq.heappush(self.active, [expire_at, amount - paid])
                self.total += amount - paid
            return
        _, amount = event
        self._drop_expired(ts)
        while amount > 0 and self.active:
            grant = self.active[0]
            take = min(amount, grant[1])
            grant[1] -= take
            self.total -= take
            amount -= take
            if grant[1] == 0:
                heapq.heappop(self.active)
        self.debt += amount           # NOTE: whatever no valid grant could cover becomes debt

    def balance(self, ts):
        self._drop_expired(ts)
        net = self.total - self.debt      # NOTE: O(1); summing the heap here would cost O(k) on every query
        return None if net < 0 else net


class GPUCreditLedger:
    def __init__(self):
        self._state = _LedgerState()

    def add_credit(self, credit_id, amount, timestamp, expiration):
        self._state.apply(timestamp, ("add", credit_id, amount, timestamp + expiration))

    def subtract(self, amount, timestamp):
        self._state.apply(timestamp, ("sub", amount))

    def get_balance(self, timestamp):
        return self._state.balance(timestamp)
```

A single `subtract` can pop several grants off the heap, but each grant is pushed once and popped at most once over its whole lifetime, so $n$ calls cost $O(n \log n)$ in total.

### Part 2

Once calls can arrive in any order, the heap can no longer be updated live: an `add_credit` for `timestamp = 35` that is called after a `subtract` for `timestamp = 42` has already been applied would have to be inserted into a heap that has moved past it. `GPUCreditLedgerAnyOrder` instead keeps every call in a plain append-only log, in call order, and rebuilds the state from scratch on every query: sort the log by `timestamp` — not call order — keep only the events at or before the query, and feed them to a fresh `_LedgerState`.

```python
class GPUCreditLedgerAnyOrder:
    def __init__(self):
        self._events = []   # append-only, call order -- NOT necessarily sorted by timestamp

    def add_credit(self, credit_id, amount, timestamp, expiration):
        self._events.append((timestamp, ("add", credit_id, amount, timestamp + expiration)))

    def subtract(self, amount, timestamp):
        self._events.append((timestamp, ("sub", amount)))

    def get_balance(self, timestamp):
        state = _LedgerState()
        for ts, event in sorted(e for e in self._events if e[0] <= timestamp):   # NOTE: sorted by
            state.apply(ts, event)                                              # timestamp, not call order
        return state.balance(timestamp)
```

This is correct for any arrival order, but every `get_balance` call re-sorts and replays the whole relevant log: $O(n \log n)$ for the $n$ calls at or before the query, every single time.

### Part 3

Two things make Part 2 slow under many queries: it sorts the log again on every call, and it replays every event from the start even when the previous query's timestamp was almost the same. `GPUCreditLedgerFast` fixes both, and is fast only on the pattern the statement targets:

- Keep the log sorted by timestamp incrementally with `bisect.insort`, instead of sorting from scratch on every query.
- Keep a *cursor*: the `_LedgerState` left after applying every stored event up to the highest timestamp queried so far. A query at or past the cursor only has to apply the events between the two.
- A query behind the cursor asks about the past. The cursor's state already contains later events and cannot be rewound, so such a query falls back to one full replay, as in Part 2, and leaves the cursor alone.
- An `add_credit`/`subtract` that lands at or behind the cursor invalidates it: the state was built without this event, so the cursor is dropped and rebuilt lazily by the next query.
- Answers are cached by timestamp, so asking the same timestamp again is a dictionary lookup. Every cached timestamp is at or behind the cursor, so an event past the cursor cannot change a cached answer, and a late event clears the cache together with the cursor.

```python
import bisect


class GPUCreditLedgerFast:
    def __init__(self):
        self._log = []                        # (timestamp, event), kept sorted by timestamp
        self._cursor_ts = float("-inf")       # highest timestamp queried since the last late event
        self._cursor_idx = 0                  # index into self._log of the next event to apply
        self._state = _LedgerState()          # every event at or before self._cursor_ts, applied
        self._cache = {}                      # every key is <= self._cursor_ts

    def _insert_event(self, timestamp, event):
        bisect.insort(self._log, (timestamp, event))
        if timestamp <= self._cursor_ts:      # NOTE: a late event -- drop the cursor and every cached answer
            self._cursor_ts, self._cursor_idx = float("-inf"), 0
            self._state = _LedgerState()
            self._cache.clear()

    def add_credit(self, credit_id, amount, timestamp, expiration):
        self._insert_event(timestamp, ("add", credit_id, amount, timestamp + expiration))

    def subtract(self, amount, timestamp):
        self._insert_event(timestamp, ("sub", amount))

    def get_balance(self, timestamp):
        if timestamp in self._cache:
            return self._cache[timestamp]
        if timestamp >= self._cursor_ts:
            while self._cursor_idx < len(self._log) and self._log[self._cursor_idx][0] <= timestamp:
                self._state.apply(*self._log[self._cursor_idx])
                self._cursor_idx += 1
            self._cursor_ts = timestamp
            state = self._state
        else:                                 # NOTE: a query behind the cursor -- one full replay, O(n log n)
            state = _LedgerState()
            for ts, event in self._log:
                if ts > timestamp:
                    break
                state.apply(ts, event)
        self._cache[timestamp] = state.balance(timestamp)
        return self._cache[timestamp]
```

While the cursor only ever advances — non-decreasing queries, no late event — every stored event is applied exactly once over the life of the ledger and every grant is pushed and popped at most once, $O(U \log U)$ in total; beyond that a query is a dictionary lookup and one subtraction, for $O(U \log U + Q)$ altogether. `bisect.insort` still costs $O(n)$ per call to shift the list; if `add_credit`/`subtract` calls are frequent too, replace the list with a balanced tree keyed by timestamp, such as the treap in Memory Allocator. On 2,000 out-of-order `add_credit`/`subtract` calls followed by 20,000 non-decreasing queries, it answers the queries faster than Part 2 by well over two orders of magnitude.

### Follow-ups

- Enforcing credit in production: check `get_balance` before starting the expensive work a request stands for, admit the request only if the balance covers its estimated cost, and `subtract` the actual cost afterwards. Letting `subtract` always succeed and run up debt is a bookkeeping choice, not a spending policy.
- Frequent late events: snapshot the state every so many events, so that a late event rewinds only to the nearest snapshot before it instead of to the start; once the log is persisted, the same snapshots are the recovery checkpoints.
- Reversing a `subtract`: a correct refund has to remember which grants the call drained and by how much, so that exactly those amounts are restored; issuing a fresh grant instead changes when the credit expires.
- Two events at the same `timestamp`: once that is allowed, the ledger needs an explicit tie-break as a secondary sort key — grants before subtracts, say, then call order.
- Rejecting a late `add_credit` instead of absorbing it: track the highest timestamp any `get_balance` has already answered, and raise on any `add_credit`/`subtract` landing at or before it.
