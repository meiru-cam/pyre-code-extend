Worth confirming first: this assumes `check` (and its batched and multi-game variants) must be called strictly one at a time. If the real system instead lets several requests fly concurrently, the delay disappears and plain binary search is enough.

### Part 1

Because the argument passed to call $i$ is fixed before call $i$'s own return value exists, you never know the comparison for the guess you *just* made — only for the one before it. The sequence of calls therefore has to alternate two roles: a *real* probe, the midpoint of the current `[lo, hi]`, and a *filler*, whose only job is to make the next call happen so the real probe's comparison comes back. Whichever value the filler takes becomes the *next* pending guess, so its own comparison is processed on equal footing with a real probe's. The very first filler has no choice but to land inside `[lo, hi]`, since nothing has been ruled out yet; later ones go to the untouched ends of `[1, n]`, where the answer is already known. Either way the loop narrows on whatever comes back and needs no special case.

```python
def find_secret(n, check):
    if n == 1:
        return 1                        # only one candidate: nothing to compare
    lo, hi = 1, n
    used = set()
    right_scan, left_scan = n, 1        # frontiers for filler values outside [lo, hi]

    def real_probe():
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        for delta in range(hi - lo + 1):           # NOTE: nudge off mid if a stray filler already used it
            for cand in (mid - delta, mid + delta):
                if lo <= cand <= hi and cand not in used:
                    return cand

    def filler():
        nonlocal right_scan, left_scan
        while right_scan > hi:                       # values above hi are provably irrelevant
            cand, right_scan = right_scan, right_scan - 1
            if cand not in used:
                return cand
        while left_scan < lo:                        # then values below lo
            cand, left_scan = left_scan, left_scan + 1
            if cand not in used:
                return cand
        for x in range(lo, hi + 1):      # NOTE: the first filler always lands here (nothing is
            if x not in used:            # outside [lo, hi] yet), and so do fillers once [1, n] runs dry
                return x

    pending = real_probe()
    used.add(pending)
    check(pending)
    is_real = True                      # role of `pending`: was it this round's bisection probe?

    while True:
        if lo == hi:
            return lo
        nxt = filler() if is_real else real_probe()
        used.add(nxt)
        r = check(nxt)
        # NOTE: narrow on ANY revealed comparison, real or filler -- a filler forced inside
        # [lo, hi] (only for tiny n) is still honest information about secret.
        if r == 0:
            return pending
        elif r == -1:
            lo = max(lo, pending + 1)
        elif r == 1:
            hi = min(hi, pending - 1)
        pending = nxt
        is_real = not is_real
        if lo == hi:
            return lo
```

Real probes land on calls $1, 3, 5, \dots$ and each is revealed by the filler right after it, on calls $2, 4, 6, \dots$. So after $2k$ calls, exactly $k$ real probes have been revealed, and each one either finds `secret` exactly or halves `[lo, hi]`; $k = \lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ of them therefore leave at most one candidate, which fits in $2\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ calls. A probe nudged off the midpoint because a filler already took that value cuts a little less, so the checks below measure the count directly — every secret for every $n$ below 400, then 54 sizes up to $10^9$ — and it never exceeds $2\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$: the call the signature allows for retrieving a pending comparison is never spent.

### Part 2

The same alternation works with a batch of two: submitting the two points that cut `[lo, hi]` into thirds, `lo + (hi - lo)//3` and `lo + 2*(hi - lo)//3`, and reading their comparisons back one round later narrows to whichever third contains `secret`, instead of whichever half. Once at most two candidates are left a single probe already settles them, so a real round there submits one point — exactly Part 1's bisection — which is also what keeps a value free for the next filler when `n` itself is as small as 2.

```python
def find_secret_batched(n, check_batch):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    lo, hi = 1, n
    used = set()
    right_scan, left_scan = n, 1

    def nudge(target, avoid):
        for delta in range(hi - lo + 1):
            for cand in (target - delta, target + delta):
                if lo <= cand <= hi and cand not in used and cand not in avoid:
                    return cand
        return None

    def real_points():
        if hi - lo + 1 <= 2:                  # NOTE: one point already settles two candidates,
            p = nudge((lo + hi) // 2, set())  # and for tiny n it leaves the filler a value to use
            return [p] if p is not None else []
        t1, t2 = lo + (hi - lo) // 3, lo + 2 * (hi - lo) // 3
        p1 = nudge(t1, set())
        p2 = nudge(t2, {p1} if p1 is not None else set())
        return [p for p in (p1, p2) if p is not None]

    def filler():
        nonlocal right_scan, left_scan
        while right_scan > hi:
            cand, right_scan = right_scan, right_scan - 1
            if cand not in used:
                return cand
        while left_scan < lo:
            cand, left_scan = left_scan, left_scan + 1
            if cand not in used:
                return cand
        for x in range(lo, hi + 1):
            if x not in used:
                return x

    def apply(xs, rs):
        nonlocal lo, hi
        found = None
        for x, r in zip(xs, rs):
            if r == -1: lo = max(lo, x + 1)
            elif r == 1: hi = min(hi, x - 1)
            else: found = x
        return found

    pending = real_points()
    used.update(pending)
    check_batch(pending)
    is_real = True

    while True:
        if lo == hi:
            return lo
        nxt = [filler()] if is_real else real_points()
        used.update(nxt)
        rs = check_batch(nxt)
        found = apply(pending, rs)
        if found is not None:
            return found
        pending = nxt
        is_real = not is_real
        if lo == hi:
            return lo
```

The same accounting applies with 3 in place of 2: $k = \lceil \log_3 n \rceil$ revealed real rounds always leave at most one candidate, so at most $2\lceil \log_3 n \rceil$ calls. Since $\lceil \log_3 n \rceil \le \lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ for every $n$, this never loses to Part 1, and the two pull apart by the factor $\log_2 3 \approx 1.58$ as $n$ grows: at $n = 10^9$ the checks below measure 38 calls against Part 1's 58.

### Part 3

With several games sharing the channel, a round no longer needs an artificial filler value at all: submit every still-unsolved game's own midpoint in one round, then submit nothing (an empty dict) the round after, purely to let that round's comparisons come back. Every game rides the same two-round rhythm and drops out of the dict the moment its own `[lo, hi]` collapses, so the number of rounds is fixed only by whichever game needs the most halvings -- exactly Part 1's bound applied to the largest `n[g]`; every smaller game finishes for free along the way.

```python
def solve_games(bounds, check_round):
    lo = {g: 1 for g in bounds}
    hi = dict(bounds)
    solved = {g: lo[g] == hi[g] for g in bounds}     # n[g] == 1: nothing to ask

    def apply(batch, results):
        if not results:
            return
        for g, r in results.items():
            x = batch[g]
            if r == -1: lo[g] = max(lo[g], x + 1)
            elif r == 1: hi[g] = min(hi[g], x - 1)
            else: lo[g] = hi[g] = x
            solved[g] = lo[g] == hi[g]

    pending, is_real = {}, True
    while not all(solved.values()):
        # NOTE: recomputed fresh every real round, so a game that just finished simply drops out
        guesses = {g: (lo[g] + hi[g]) // 2 for g in bounds if not solved[g]} if is_real else {}
        results = check_round(guesses)
        apply(pending, results)
        pending, is_real = guesses, not is_real
    return {g: lo[g] for g in bounds}
```

Let $k = \lceil \log_2(\max_g n[g]) \rceil$. The largest game alone costs Part 1's $2k$ calls, and `solve_games` spends exactly those $2k$ rounds however many games ride along. No protocol can beat $\lceil \log_2(n + 1) \rceil$ rounds on a game of size $n$: after $r$ rounds at most $r - 1$ of its comparisons have come back, and $c$ three-way comparisons separate at most $2^{c+1} - 1$ values, so $n \le 2^r - 1$. The checks below put numbers on both ends: 30 games with $n$ up to $10^9$ finish together in 58 rounds against that floor of 30, versus 1694 calls solving them one at a time.

### Follow-ups

- If `check` can be called concurrently (several requests in flight before any reply), the delay disappears and plain binary search suffices in $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ calls.
- Part 2's idea generalizes to $b - 1$ points per round, cutting `[lo, hi]` by a factor of $b$ per revealed round; push $b$ too far and the batch size itself, not the round count, becomes the bottleneck.
- A Fibonacci/golden-ratio strategy can in principle approach $1.44 \log_2 n$ calls for Part 1 by letting a probe's role depend on a ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers instead of the exact midpoint; constructing and proving it correct under this exact delay is considerably more involved than the bound above.
- Part 3's lockstep round can also submit Part 2's ternary points per game instead of a single midpoint, combining both speedups into about $2\lceil \log_3(\max_g n[g]) \rceil$ rounds.
- A network failure that silently drops one call has no signal in this protocol; the two-role alternation would need a sequence number or a timeout-and-retry rule bolted onto `check`.
