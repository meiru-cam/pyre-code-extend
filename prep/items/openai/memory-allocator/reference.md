Worth confirming with the interviewer before coding: whether `free` gets the size back (assumed here, with the alternative in the follow-ups) and whether placement must stay first fit once sped up, which Part 2 assumes throughout.

### Part 1

Keep the free blocks in a plain list sorted by start address. `allocate` scans left to right and stops at the first block of sufficient size — first fit, by construction. `free` finds the index `i` of the first block starting at or after `address`; block `i - 1` is the only possible left neighbour and block `i` the only possible right neighbour, which gives the four merge cases directly. The `allocated` map is for validation only: freeing `(address, size)` is legal exactly when `address` is a key of `allocated` with value `size`, which is the three rejected conditions in one check.

```python
class MemoryAllocator:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        if capacity <= 0:
            raise ValueError("capacity must be positive")
        self.gaps = [[0, capacity]]        # NOTE: not self.free -- would shadow the free() method below
        self.allocated = {}                # address -> size, for validating free()

    def allocate(self, size):
        if size <= 0:
            raise ValueError("size must be positive")
        for gap in self.gaps:              # NOTE: linear scan; the first block with enough room wins
            if gap[1] >= size:
                start = gap[0]
                if gap[1] == size:
                    self.gaps.remove(gap)
                else:
                    gap[0] += size
                    gap[1] -= size
                self.allocated[start] = size
                return start
        raise MemoryError(f"no free block of size >= {size}")

    def free(self, address, size):
        if size <= 0 or self.allocated.get(address) != size:
            raise ValueError(f"invalid free({address}, {size})")
        del self.allocated[address]
        i = 0
        while i < len(self.gaps) and self.gaps[i][0] < address:
            i += 1
        # NOTE: read both flags first -- merging into gaps[i - 1] must not disturb index i below
        merge_left = i > 0 and self.gaps[i - 1][0] + self.gaps[i - 1][1] == address
        merge_right = i < len(self.gaps) and address + size == self.gaps[i][0]
        if merge_left and merge_right:
            self.gaps[i - 1][1] += size + self.gaps[i][1]
            del self.gaps[i]
        elif merge_left:
            self.gaps[i - 1][1] += size
        elif merge_right:
            self.gaps[i][0] = address
            self.gaps[i][1] += size
        else:
            self.gaps.insert(i, [address, size])
```

Both operations cost $O(n)$ time, $n$ the count of free blocks: the scan itself, and — because blocks live in a plain list — `list.insert` and `list.remove`, which shift every later element.

### Part 2

Speeding up `free` is the easy half: keep every free block in a tree ordered by start address, which answers "predecessor" and "successor" of a key in $O(\log n)$, and Part 1's four merge cases become exactly one predecessor lookup and one successor lookup.

`allocate` needs care about *which* tree. *Best fit* (smallest free block that is still `>= size`) reduces to a predecessor query in a tree ordered by *size* — it must be a real balanced tree, not a plain Python list: `bisect.bisect_left` finds the position in $O(\log n)$, but `list.insert` there still shifts every later element, $O(n)$ regardless of how the position was found. *First fit* asks for something a size-ordered tree cannot answer: the block with the **lowest address** whose size is `>= size` — two orderings at once, and the size tree has already discarded the address one.

One tree can serve both roles: order it by start address (so merge stays $O(\log n)$), and additionally store, at every node, the *maximum block size in its own subtree*. The first-fit query walks down from the root: if the left subtree's maximum is `>= size`, the answer is there, since every address in it is smaller than the current node's; else the current node is the answer if it is big enough, being the smallest address reached so far; else the answer is in the right subtree — one discarded subtree per step, so the query costs $O(h)$, $h$ the tree's height. The code below is a *treap*: a binary search tree keyed by address, kept balanced in expectation by giving every node an independent random priority and maintaining a max-heap on it through the `split`/`merge` pair, so insertion, deletion and re-deriving the max-size augmentation are all $O(\log n)$ in expectation too.

```python
import random


class _Node:
    __slots__ = ("start", "size", "priority", "left", "right", "max_size")

    def __init__(self, start, size):
        self.start, self.size, self.max_size = start, size, size

        return a or b
    if a.priority > b.priority:
        a.right = _merge(a.right, b)
        _pull(a)
        return a
    b.left = _merge(a, b.left)
    _pull(b)
    return b

def _split(node, key):                          # -> (start <= key, start > key), same relative order
    if node is None:
        return None, None
    if node.start <= key:
        lo, hi = _split(node.right, key)
        node.right = lo
        _pull(node)
        return node, hi
    lo, hi = _split(node.left, key)
    node.left = hi
    _pull(node)
    return lo, node

def _insert(root, start, size):

    return _merge(lo2, hi)

def _first_fit(node, size):                     # leftmost node with size >= `size`, else None
    if node is None or node.max_size < size:
        return None
    if node.left and node.left.max_size >= size:    # NOTE: left subtree only has smaller addresses
        return _first_fit(node.left, size)
    return node if node.size >= size else _first_fit(node.right, size)

def _neighbours(node, key):                     # (predecessor, successor) of `key`, one walk down
    pred = succ = None
    while node:
        if node.start < key:
            pred, node = node, node.right
        else:
            succ, node = node, node.left
    return pred, succ


class MemoryAllocatorLog:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        if capacity <= 0:
            raise ValueError("capacity must be positive")
        self._free = _Node(0, capacity)         # treap root; None once memory is exhausted

            raise MemoryError(f"no free block of size >= {size}")
        start = node.start
        self._free = _delete(self._free, start)
        if node.size > size:
            self._free = _insert(self._free, start + size, node.size - size)
        self.allocated[start] = size
        return start

    def free(self, address, size):
        if size <= 0 or self.allocated.get(address) != size:
            raise ValueError(f"invalid free({address}, {size})")
        del self.allocated[address]
        pred, succ = _neighbours(self._free, address)
        start, total = address, size
        if pred is not None and pred.start + pred.size == address:
            start, total = pred.start, pred.size + total
            self._free = _delete(self._free, pred.start)
        if succ is not None and address + size == succ.start:
            total += succ.size
            self._free = _delete(self._free, succ.start)
        self._free = _insert(self._free, start, total)
```

An adversarial sequence of priorities could unbalance this treap — the usual caveat for any randomized balanced tree — which a deterministic AVL or red-black tree would remove at the cost of more bookkeeping.

### Follow-ups

- **Alignment.** To keep every address a multiple of some `a` (e.g. 8), round `size` up to the next multiple of `a` before carving the block, so the following block also starts aligned.
- **Realloc.** Growing in place only works when a large-enough free block follows; otherwise the contents must be copied into a fresh block from `allocate`, which the caller sees as a new address.
- **Thread safety.** One lock around the whole allocator is the simplest correct option; splitting it by size class needs a lock order, since a `free` can touch a neighbour tracked under another class.
- **External fragmentation.** Picking first fit or best fit per call, through an added `strategy` argument, needs a second index for best fit ordered by `(size, start)` so ties go to the lower address, kept in sync with every merge in `free`. Segregated free lists route each request to a list of same-size blocks instead; the buddy system keeps every block a power of two, so a freed block's buddy is found by flipping one address bit, making merging $O(1)$ at the cost of rounding every request up.
- **`free` without a size.** Recording the size at allocation time — the `allocated` map here, or a header just before the returned address in a real allocator — is required, or nothing tells `free(address)` how many bytes to release.
