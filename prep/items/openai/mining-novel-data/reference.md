Worth confirming before designing: whether "novel" is judged against the training set alone or also against production traffic, and whether the frozen encoder comes with a text encoder trained into the same space (CLIP-style), which text-only targets rely on. The design below takes the training set as the reference and assumes such an encoder; without one, those targets first get a few seed images from a separate image-text model run over a corpus sample.

### Requirements and scale

**Cascade and corpus size.** Exact and perceptual-hash de-duplication first removes exact copies, recompressions, resizes and slight crops (a 10% crop or a mirror flip already changes a third to a half of the hash's 64 bits, close to an unrelated image, so those are left to the embedding-based near-duplicate check); if that discards 15%, $S_1 = 0.85\, N_{\text{raw}} = 6.8\times10^9$ images remain. A cheap quality filter (corrupted files, near-blank images, extreme aspect ratios) removes a further 20%, leaving $S_2 = 0.80\, S_1 = 5.44\times10^9$ images to embed.

**GPU-time to embed the corpus once.** At $T_{\text{qual}} = 4{,}000$ images/sec/GPU for the quality filter and $T_{\text{embed}} = 800$ for the embedding model (roughly a ViT-L-sized encoder at 224px, about 40% of an A100's bf16 peak), filtering costs $S_1 / T_{\text{qual}} \approx 472$ GPU-hours and embedding $S_2 / T_{\text{embed}} \approx 1{,}889$, about 2,361 combined: 18.4 hours on the 128 GPUs, under 16% of the 15,360 GPU-hours in 5 days. Embedding $N_{\text{raw}}$ directly would cost $N_{\text{raw}} / T_{\text{embed}} \approx 2{,}778$ GPU-hours, 417 more; Deep dive (c) shows where that saving comes from.

**Vector storage and nearest-neighbor index memory.** At $d = 768$, the $S_2$ vectors take $S_2 \cdot d \cdot 2 \approx 7.6$ TiB in float16, $\approx 3.8$ TiB quantized to int8. An HNSW graph over them ($M_0 = 32$ base-layer neighbors, 4-byte ids, 30% upper-layer overhead) adds $\approx 0.82$ TiB, for a $\approx 4.6$ TiB corpus index: 19 shards at 256 GiB of index memory per node. The training set's index, over $N_{\text{train}} = 4\times10^8$ vectors, is only $\approx 348$ GiB, two such nodes.

**De-duplication and neighbor queries.** The hash needs only a 32×32 thumbnail, so its cost is a reduced-size JPEG decode, about 1 ms per image per core, or 67 minutes on 2,000 cores; but the stage reads all 800 TB, and at an assumed 100 GB/s from object storage the read, about 2.2 hours, sets its time. The two neighbor passes (against the corpus index for near-duplicates and density, against the training-set index for distance to training) run on the index nodes' CPUs. Vectors are spread across shards at random, so every query visits every shard, and total query work grows with the shard count (a graph search grows only logarithmically with shard size), which is why the shards are few and large. At an assumed 1 ms of one core per visit, each of the 21 64-core nodes serves all $S_2$ queries in $S_2 \times 1\,\text{ms} / 64 \approx 24$ hours, all in parallel: about $3.2\times10^4$ core-hours, off the GPUs.

**Target-object scan.** The 200 targets bring at most 5 query vectors each; scoring all 1,000 against every stored vector is $2 \cdot S_2 \cdot d \cdot 1{,}000 \approx 8.4\times10^{15}$ operations, 42 seconds of one GPU at an assumed 200 TFLOPS. The read, not the arithmetic, is the bound: each 1,536-byte vector feeds 1,000 dot products, about 1,000 operations per byte, so a GPU would need 200 GB/s of vectors, but the 7.6 TiB is 100 times one GPU's memory and a PCIe link carries about 25 GB/s: about 6 minutes on one GPU, or about 1.4 minutes across the fleet, set by the 100 GB/s read from the vector store. The in-corpus pass cannot be brute-forced: with $S_2$ queries it is compute-bound, $d \cdot S_2^2 \approx 2.3\times10^{22}$ operations counting each pair once, about 31,600 GPU-hours, twice the 5-day budget; hence the approximate index.

### Data and pipeline interfaces

**Image record**, one row per corpus image, updated in place as it moves through the stages: `image_id`, `source_url`, `content_hash`, `phash` (64-bit perceptual hash), `dup_group` (its near-duplicate group), `width`, `height`, `stage` (`raw | deduped | quality_kept | embedded | scored`), `quality_score`, `embedding_ref` (a pointer into the vector store), `train_nn_dist` (distance to the nearest training-set neighbor), `corpus_knn_dist` (distance to its 5th-nearest in-corpus neighbor, the density signal of Deep dive (a)), `target_hits` (`[{target_id, stage: "zero_shot" | "detector" | "classifier", score, bbox}]`).

Pipeline interfaces, one per stage, each idempotent per shard (see Deep dive (c)):

- `dedup_shard(shard_id) -> DedupManifest` — hashes a shard of raw images, writes `{image_id, content_hash, phash, dup_group, keep}` for every image.
- `quality_filter_shard(shard_id) -> QualityManifest` — runs the quality model on the kept images, writes `{image_id, quality_score, keep}`.
- `embed_shard(shard_id) -> EmbeddingManifest` — embeds, writes the vectors to the vector store and `{image_id, embedding_ref}` to the manifest.
- `score_novelty_shard(shard_id) -> NoveltyManifest` — queries both indexes, writes `{image_id, train_nn_dist, corpus_knn_dist}` and merges embedding-level near-duplicates into `dup_group`.
- `retrieve_target(target_id, query_embeddings, top_k) -> RankedCandidates` — scores `query_embeddings` (from a target's example images or description) exactly against every stored vector, returns the `top_k` `{image_id, score}` pairs.

Human review goes through `submit_for_review(image_ids, task) -> batch_id` and `get_review_labels(batch_id) -> labels`, charged against the shared 6,000-image budget.

An image passes hash de-dup and the quality filter, is embedded, and lands in the corpus vector index; novelty scoring queries that index for in-corpus density and the training-set index for distance from what the model already knows, and the top-ranked candidates go into the novel-augmentation manifest. A target's query vectors, built once from its example images or description, are scanned against every stored vector; the open-vocabulary detector re-examines only the resulting shortlist, and its confirmed hits, with a sample of the novelty manifest, go to human review, whose labels feed back into retrieval as the active-learning signal of Deep dive (b).

### Deep dives

**How "novel" is defined and measured.** *Distance to the nearest training-set neighbor* is cheap, the query already run above, but alone ranks isolated outliers as high as genuine novelty: a one-off oddity (a garbled render, an extreme crop) is far from every training image precisely because nothing else looks like it. *Low likelihood under a density model* fit to training embeddings fails the same way. *High predictive uncertainty* of the existing classifier (high entropy; loss needs labels) also flags ambiguous examples of known classes, and misses novel images it labels confidently, as softmax classifiers often do far from their training data. *Under-covered clusters*, whose training-set share is far below their corpus share, ignore stray points and are cheap (one assignment pass against $10^5$ centroids is about 1 GPU-hour), but depend on granularity: at $10^5$ clusters the average one holds 54,000 images, enough to hide a new concept of a few thousand.

The design uses a local form of the cluster check, with no granularity to choose: an image qualifies only if its `corpus_knn_dist` is below a threshold (it has several similar images in the corpus), and qualifying images are ranked by distance to the training set. On synthetic 2-D data (three Gaussian training clusters; a corpus adding two clusters absent from training plus 20 scattered points standing in for oddities, 2.6% of it), ranking by distance alone put all 15 farthest points, and 15 of the top-decile 77, in the scattered group. Keeping only points whose 5th-nearest in-corpus neighbor is closer than the 70th-percentile distance, then taking the 77 farthest, selected none of them and raised recall on the new clusters from 20.7% to 25.7%; using the density check as a second fixed cutoff instead shrank the selection to 33 and recall to 11.0%, so the check filters before ranking. The counts are this setup's; over 50 seeds the direction held.

Novelty is not usefulness either, so a small controlled experiment gates any larger backfill. It takes 2,000 of the 6,000 labels: 750 novelty-selected images and 750 drawn uniformly from the quality-kept corpus, all labeled with the team's classes, and a 500-image evaluation slice drawn uniformly from the corpus with near-duplicates of every added image removed, so nothing trained on reappears in evaluation. Two linear probes on the frozen encoder, trained on the same training-set subset plus either the 750 novel or the 750 random images, are compared on the slice and on the existing validation set; the novel arm must win on the first without losing on the second. With 500 evaluation images only large differences show, so this is a go/no-go gate, not a measurement.

**Target-object retrieval.** *Zero-shot retrieval* scores every corpus embedding against a target's query vectors (averaged example-image embeddings, or the text encoder's embedding of the description): cheap and training-free, but a query for "a red bicycle" also surfaces bicycle shops and similarly colored objects, so precision is weak. *An open-vocabulary detector* scores candidate boxes against the description, or against example images for detectors that accept image queries; it localizes the object and is far more precise, but at an assumed 30 images/sec/GPU all of $S_2$ would take about 50,000 GPU-hours, over three times the budget. *A lightweight classifier* on the frozen embeddings (a prototype or heavily regularized linear head) is cheap at corpus scale, but with 3-10 positives it needs mined negatives and regularization to avoid latching onto whatever those few examples happen to share.

The design cascades all three. The exact scan returns 20,000 candidates per target; the detector re-scores only those, $4\times10^6$ images or about 37 GPU-hours, dropping unconfirmed ones; once a target's confirmed hits reach a few dozen, the classifier trains on them and pulls in candidates the scan under-ranked, in an active-learning loop that sends borderline images, not random ones, to review, since an obvious hit or miss teaches the classifier little. Those labels are not a random sample, so they never enter the precision and recall estimates.

Both estimates come from labeled samples. For precision, a target's hits are split into score bins and a fixed number per bin is labeled; precision above a threshold is the size-weighted average $\sum_h N_h \hat p_h / \sum_h N_h$ over the bins above it ($N_h$ a bin's size, $\hat p_h$ its labeled hit rate); a few thousand labels leave each target's own figure coarse, so bins are pooled across targets as well. For recall, the *rule of three*: if $n$ images drawn uniformly at random from a large set contain no positive, the one-sided 95% upper bound on the set's positive rate is $1 - 0.05^{1/n} \approx 3/n$. Drawn from the $N$ undelivered images, it bounds the misses at $3N/n$, so $F / (F + 3N/n)$, with $F$ the verified true positives delivered, is a 95% lower bound on recall. At this scale it is useless: $N \approx S_2$, $n = 2{,}000$ and $F = 3{,}000$ give recall of at least 0.04%, and certifying 50% would take $n \approx 5.4\times10^6$. The budget can instead measure recall within a deep pool, say a target's top $10^6$ by zero-shot score: its undelivered part is split into score bands, each sampled, and a band's misses are bounded by its size times an exact binomial upper bound on its rate (the zero-hit formula when it has none), each of the $H$ bands at confidence $1 - 0.05/H$ so the sum holds at 95% (a union bound). A near-zero rate in the deepest band shows the ranking has run dry; below the pool only the weak bound applies, and even this is affordable only for the highest-priority targets.

**Scale and cost.** Reprocessing the whole corpus on every change is simple, but each tweak then costs the full 2,361 GPU-hours. Instead each stage writes its manifest under `(shard_id, stage, config_hash)`, the hash covering the stage's config and the keys of the manifests it read, so a change re-runs exactly the stages downstream of it, and a crashed run retries in place because a shard counts as done only once its manifest exists. Stages store scores beside decisions (`quality_score` beside `keep`), so moving a threshold re-reads scores rather than re-running a model. The cost is the manifest store and hashing every config.

A filter placed before the embedding model saves GPU time only if the fraction $r$ it drops exceeds $T_{\text{embed}} / T$, where $T$ is its own throughput. The CPU hash de-dup drops 15% at no GPU cost and accounts for the whole 417 GPU-hour saving; the quality filter, dropping 20% at a fifth of the embedding cost per image, exactly breaks even (472 GPU-hours spent, 472 saved) and earns its place by keeping junk out of the index and the novelty set.

### Follow-ups

- Mining medical images targets something different: "effective, high-signal" is not "novel", since a striking scan can be clinically uninformative; the score would add agreement with a small, clinician-verified set to distance from training.
- When a target's examples span several visual styles, averaging them into one query vector can wash out a mode; clustering the examples and querying each centroid (up to the 5 vectors per target) covers each style.
- A pattern repeated thousands of times in the crawl but never in training passes the density check easily and could flood the novelty set; capping how many selected images may share one `dup_group` stops it.
