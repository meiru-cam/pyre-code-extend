Worth confirming before designing: whether the server may cache a conversation's prompt prefix between turns (assumed not — every turn prefills its whole prompt) and whether a canary version can take over mid-conversation (assumed no).

### Requirements and scale

**Request rate.** $43{,}200{,}000$ messages/day average to $43{,}200{,}000 / 86{,}400 = 500$ requests/sec; at 6x for the daily peak, peak submissions run at $3{,}000$ requests/sec.

**KV cache per token.** With 32 layers, 8 KV heads, head dimension 128, and fp16 (2 bytes), one token's key and value together cost

$$
2 \times 32 \times 8 \times 128 \times 2 = 131{,}072 \text{ bytes} = 128 \text{ KiB.}
$$

Of the 80 GiB per GPU, 40 GiB holds the weights and 4 GiB the activation reserve, leaving a **36 GiB KV cache pool** per replica.

**What a decode step actually costs.** A replica does not only decode: the prompts it is serving have to be prefilled on the same GPU. A replica finishing $r$ requests/sec must prefill $1{,}200r$ tokens/sec, and since one step emits a token for each of its 128 sequences it runs $300r/128$ steps/sec — so each step carries $128 \times 1{,}200/300 = 512$ tokens of prefill, $512/12{,}000 \approx 42.7$ ms on top of the 40 ms decode. **A step lands every $\approx 82.7$ ms, not 40 ms**, which is also the rate a user sees tokens arrive: $\approx 12.1$/sec, just above the 10 tokens/sec floor.

**Concurrency and replica pool.** A 300-token reply therefore holds a slot for $W = 300 \times 0.0827 = 24.8$ s (its own prefill rides inside those steps). By Little's law, $L = \lambda \cdot W$: at peak, $L_{\text{peak}} = 3{,}000 \times 24.8 = 74{,}400$ sequences in flight. At 128 per replica and 20% headroom for replicas booting or failing health checks, $74{,}400 / 128 \times 1.2 = 697.5$, rounded up to **698 replicas**, draining $698 \times 128 / 24.8 \approx 3{,}603$ requests/sec — peak arrival runs the pool at $\approx 83\%$ utilization. Counting GPU time directly gives the same count and also splits the bill: $1{,}200/12{,}000 + 300 \times 0.040/128 = 0.194$ GPU-seconds per request, 52% prefill.

**First-token latency.** A 1,200-token prompt is prefilled in $\lceil 1{,}200/512 \rceil = 3$ chunked steps (the batching deep dive sets the 512-token budget): 3 decode passes (120 ms), its own 100 ms of prefill, and 15 ms of routing and tokenization, $\approx 235$ ms against the paid tier's 600 ms target. A 16,000-token prompt needs 32 chunks and $\approx 2{,}628$ ms — an 11x gap the batching deep dive is about, and why the target stops at 2,000-token prompts.

**KV cache headroom.** A request's KV footprint averages input plus half of output (it grows from input to input-plus-output as it decodes), $1{,}200 + 150 = 1{,}350$ tokens, or $168.75$ MiB. A full batch of 128 uses $\approx 21.1$ GiB of the 36 GiB pool, leaving $\approx 14.9$ GiB for the long-context tail.

**Daily cost.** $43{,}200{,}000$ requests/day at 1,200 input and 300 output tokens each is $51.84 \times 10^9$ input and $12.96 \times 10^9$ output tokens/day. At \$0.03/\$0.10 per 1,000 tokens, that's $\$1{,}555{,}200 + \$1{,}296{,}000 = \$2{,}851{,}200$/day, or $\$0.066$/request.

### Data model and API

**Conversation** — `conversation_id`, `user_id`, `title`, `pinned_model_version` (fixed at creation by the canary router), `created_at`, `last_message_at`.

**Message** — `message_id`, `conversation_id`, `role` (`user | assistant`), `content`, `status` (`pending | streaming | complete | error`), `model_version`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `idempotency_key`, `created_at`.

**InferenceRequest** — one row per model call: `request_id`, `message_id`, `tier` (`free | plus | enterprise`), `status` (`queued | admitted | prefilling | decoding | done | cancelled | failed`), `replica_id`, `max_output_tokens` (1,024 here), `queued_at`, `first_token_at`, `completed_at`, `cost_usd`.

**RateBudget** — `user_id`, `tier`, `messages_today`, `daily_message_cap`, `reset_at`, `holds` (`{request_id: expires_at}`: an admitted message counts against the cap until it reaches a terminal state or its hold expires, so parallel submissions cannot overshoot it).

Core API:

- `POST /conversations/{id}/messages` — `{content, idempotency_key}` → `202 {message_id, stream_url}`; resubmitting with an `idempotency_key` the server has already seen hands back the existing message. `429` when the daily cap is used up, `503` with `Retry-After` when the tier's admission queue is full.
- `GET /conversations/{id}/messages/{message_id}/stream` — an SSE stream of `token` and `done` events; any number of devices can open it at once and each gets the same events, replayed from `Last-Event-ID` for one that reconnects mid-stream.
- `POST /conversations/{id}/messages/{message_id}/cancel` — idempotent; stops generation at the next decode step. The message still counts against the daily cap.
- `GET /conversations/{id}` — the conversation's messages, for a device opening it or resuming after being offline; `GET /conversations` lists the user's conversations, newest first.

### Architecture

```

A message lands at the API edge, which writes a `Message` row and an `InferenceRequest` row to the conversation store — the one place a message is authoritative — before acknowledging the client; any other device with the conversation open sees the new row on its next fetch. Admission control checks the user's `RateBudget` and the tier's admission queue (the tiering deep dive) before letting the request through. The scheduler assigns it to a replica running the conversation's `pinned_model_version`, chosen at the first message by hashing the user id into the canary router's current traffic split, so every later turn lands on the same version. The replica prefills the prompt in chunks, decodes under continuous batching (the batching deep dive), and appends each token to a per-request event buffer every gateway instance can read; the SSE gateway tails that buffer and forwards events to every device with a stream open on this message, which is how a second device sees the same reply arrive. On completion the replica commits the final `content`, token counts, and `cost_usd`, and the `done` event closes every open stream. Metrics and tracing collect queue depth and rejection rate from admission control and time-to-first-token, output rate, and batch occupancy from the pool, tagged by tier and `model_version` — the tags a canary is judged on.

### Deep dives

**Continuous batching, and interleaving prefill with decode.** Two problems come from mixing requests of very different lengths in one batch.

*Batching itself*: static batching — filling a batch of 128 and running it to completion — ties every slot to the batch's slowest member. With output length roughly exponential at mean 300 tokens, the expected maximum of 128 such samples is $300 \times H_{128} \approx 1{,}630$ tokens ($H_{128}$ the 128th harmonic number, $\approx 5.43$), so slot-holding time inflates $\approx 5.4\times$. *Continuous batching* (chosen) fills a freed slot with the next queued request the moment a sequence finishes, so a slot idles at most one step.

*Prefill vs. decode*: prefill is compute-bound (one large forward pass over the whole prompt) and decode is bandwidth-bound (one token per sequence, reading the same weights regardless of batch size) — very different profiles sharing a GPU in the 52 : 48 split the sizing above worked out. The simple arrangement, running each prefill as one uninterrupted step inside the ongoing decode batch, breaks on the long tail: a 16,000-token prefill takes $\approx 1{,}333$ ms, so that step runs $\approx 1{,}373$ ms and all 128 sequences — not just the new arrival — wait that long for their next token, $\approx 17\times$ the 82.7 ms they normally see and far past the 100 ms the 10 tokens/sec floor allows.

- *Chunked prefill* (chosen): give each step a fixed prefill budget and split prompts into chunks that fit it. The budget must cover the 512 tokens/step steady-state traffic generates, and raising it only lengthens the step, so 512 it is — exactly the 82.7 ms step the sizing assumed. A 16,000-token prompt with the budget to itself then takes $\lceil 16{,}000/512 \rceil = 32$ chunked steps. Its prefill costs the same $1{,}333$ ms of GPU time either way; what changes is that the time arrives in 32 slices of at most 42.7 ms, so no sequence waits more than 82.7 ms for its next token. The long prompt pays for it — sharing each of those 32 steps with a full decode batch slips its own first token from $\approx 1{,}388$ ms to $\approx 2{,}628$ ms.
- *Disaggregated pools* (alternative, not chosen): dedicate separate replicas to prefill and to decode, shipping each prefilled prompt's KV cache to a decode replica. The GPU count is the same — $3{,}000 \times 1{,}200/12{,}000 \times 1.2 = 360$ prefill plus $3{,}000 \times 12/128 \times 1.2 \approx 338$ decode-only is again $698$, the work being identical — and it buys a clean 40 ms step, 25 tokens/sec per stream instead of 12.1, whatever prompts arrive. It costs a 150 MiB KV handoff per average request ($\approx 439$ GiB/s fleet-wide) and two capacity knobs instead of one: the split has to track the input : output token ratio, so a shift toward longer prompts leaves the prefill pool queueing while decode capacity idles, where the co-located pool absorbs the same shift as a longer step. Revisit it once the average prompt nears 1,700 tokens, where that step reaches 100 ms and the output floor breaks.

*Admission and queueing*: near the pool's $\approx 3{,}603$ requests/sec capacity, queueing for a slot adds straight to first-token latency, so the queue is bounded by Little's law — capacity times the wait the target leaves over, $\approx 180$ requests for a 50 ms budget against the whole pool; the tiering deep dive reapplies it per tier.

**KV cache memory for long context.** The 36 GiB pool has to serve both the ordinary case and the occasional 16,000-token one.

- *Reserve the worst case upfront* (rejected): admit a request only if the pool has room for `input_tokens + max_output_tokens` reserved for its whole lifetime. An average request reserves $(1{,}200 + 1{,}024) \times 131{,}072 = 278$ MiB against $168.75$ MiB actually used — $1.65\times$ waste, $34.75$ GiB of the 36 GiB pool at a full batch, leaving $1.25$ GiB instead of $\approx 14.9$ GiB: beside a full batch not one 16,000-token sequence fits, where on-demand allocation fits 7.
- *Paged, on-demand allocation* (chosen): allocate KV cache in fixed 16-token pages (each $16 \times 131{,}072 = 2$ MiB) as a sequence actually grows, not for a length it may never reach, and free them the moment it ends. Cost: the attention kernel gathers a sequence's key/value pairs through a page table instead of one contiguous buffer — an extra indirection on every attention read.

Even with paging the pool fills: a full batch plus 8 concurrent 16,000-token sequences needs $36.7$ GiB. When the next one would not fit, something already running has to give up its cache:

- *Evict and recompute* (rejected as the default): drop the victim's KV cache and redo its prefill when it resumes — for a 16,000-token sequence the full $\approx 1{,}333$ ms again, out of the same prefill budget every other request is queued behind.
- *Swap to host memory* (chosen): move the victim's pages over the 24 GB/s link and back. A 16,000-token cache is $\approx 1.95$ GiB, so a round trip costs $\approx 175$ ms, about $7.6\times$ cheaper than recomputing it; one way for an average request ($168.75$ MiB) is $\approx 7.4$ ms. The victim is the lowest tier's largest current footprint, so one preemption frees as much room as possible, and it keeps its decode slot — preemption delays a request rather than returning it to the queue.

**Tiered rate limiting and degradation.** The per-user daily message cap bounds one account over a day, but it is not a capacity control: a surge of free traffic — say half of peak arrivals, $1{,}500$ requests/sec — ahead of paid traffic in one FIFO would push paid first-token latency past its target with every account still inside its cap. So the pool's $\approx 3{,}603$ requests/sec is split by weighted round robin, free : plus : enterprise = 1 : 3 : 6, floors of $\approx 360$, $\approx 1{,}081$, and $\approx 2{,}162$ requests/sec that no other tier's backlog can take.

The floors are work-conserving, so a tier may use idle capacity above its own: at the design's peak split (free 50%, plus 35%, enterprise 15% of $3{,}000$ requests/sec) plus and enterprise leave $\approx 2{,}103$ requests/sec free can draw on, so free's $1{,}500$ is served in full while enterprise sits at $\approx 21\%$ of its floor. Each tier also gets its own admission queue, capped by the Little's-law rule above against its floor and the wait its target allows — 50 ms for the paid tiers ($\approx 54$ and $\approx 108$ requests), 3 s for free ($\approx 1{,}081$) — past which it sheds load with `503` rather than growing a queue no target can absorb.

A floor is a share of *existing* capacity, not more of it, so when total arrivals exceed the pool every tier is squeezed toward its floor and even enterprise queues. Overflow routes instead to a standby pool of the smaller model: by the same step accounting each of its steps carries $256 \times 1{,}200/300 = 1{,}024$ prefill tokens and lands every $15 + 34.1 \approx 49$ ms, so one GPU serves $256/(300 \times 0.049) \approx 17.4$ requests/sec — $3.4\times$ a full-size replica's $\approx 5.2$, at $\approx 85$ ms to first token. A spike to $1.5\times$ the design peak leaves $\approx 897$ requests/sec over, which $\lceil 897/17.4 \rceil = 52$ standby replicas absorb: 7% of the main pool for 50% of surge headroom. A reply served there records the fallback in its `model_version` rather than the conversation's pin, so the quality drop is visible in the per-version metrics; the replicas stay warm because provisioning GPUs takes minutes.

### Follow-ups

- A retried `POST /conversations/{id}/messages` with a seen `idempotency_key`, after the client never saw the `202`, returns the existing `message_id` rather than billing a second generation.
- A canary rolled back for quality re-pins every conversation on it to the previous version at that conversation's next turn, never mid-stream; a rollback only for latency leaves them alone.
- Two devices sending on one conversation at once are not queued: the second `POST` while the first is `pending`/`streaming` gets `409`, one conversation allowing one in-flight generation.
- A replica crashing mid-generation is caught by the scheduler's health check, which marks that `InferenceRequest` `failed`; the partial output is not charged and its message hold is released, so the client's retry is the only generation billed.
