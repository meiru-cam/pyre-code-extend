Settle two things with the interviewer first: attempts are independent and restarting is free, and the goal is the probability of finishing within the budget, not the expected time. For every number you give, say whether it is a bound for all distributions, the exact worst case, or the exact value for one known distribution.

### Part 1

Since $T \ge 0$, the inequality $a \cdot \mathbf{1}[T \ge a] \le T$ holds for every $a > 0$. Taking expectations gives Markov's inequality $P(T \ge a) \le E[T] / a$, hence

$$P(T > 5) \le P(T \ge 5) \le \frac{1}{5}.$$

For $P(T \ge 5)$ the bound is attained: $T = 5$ with probability $1/5$ and $T = 0$ otherwise has mean 1. For $P(T > 5)$ it is not, because $P(T > 5) = 1/5$ would force $E[T] \ge E\bigl[T \cdot \mathbf{1}[T > 5]\bigr] > 5 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = 1$. It is approached, however: $T = 5 + \varepsilon$ with probability $1/(5 + \varepsilon)$ and $T = 0$ otherwise again has mean 1, and its tail $P(T > 5) = 1/(5 + \varepsilon)$ tends to $1/5$. So $1/5$ is the best bound, as a supremum and not as a maximum. In the same way $S(t) = P(T > t)$, the *survival function* of $T$, has $\sup S(t) = 1/t$ for every $t \ge 1$, approached by the mass $1/t$ just above $t$.

### Part 2

The two attempts are independent, so the schedule fails with probability $S(5)^2 \le 1/25$. The distribution of Part 1 brings both factors close to $1/5$ at once, because both attempts have the same timeout. The guarantee is therefore exactly $1 - 1/25 = 0.96$. The single attempt $(10)$ has $1 - 1/10 = 0.9$.

### Part 3

With $m = N + 1$ attempts and the timeout $t = 10/m$, the schedule fails with probability $S(t)^m$, which is the exact answer when $S$ is known. With only the mean known, Part 1 gives $S(t) \le 1/t = m/10$ for $m \le 10$, and the mass just above $t$ again brings all $m$ factors arbitrarily close to this bound at once:

$$\text{guarantee} = 1 - \left(\frac{m}{10}\right)^{m} = 1 - \left(\frac{N+1}{10}\right)^{N+1}, \qquad N + 1 \le 10.$$

For $N + 1 \ge 10$ the timeout is at most 1 and the guarantee is 0. A request that always takes $T = 1$ never finishes within a timeout below 1, and for the timeout 1 the distribution $T = 1 + \varepsilon$ with probability $1/(1 + \varepsilon)$, $T = 0$ otherwise, fails with probability $(1 + \varepsilon)^{-10} \to 1$.

### Part 4

Minimise the failure probability $(m/10)^m$ through its logarithm $f(m) = m \ln(m/10)$, first over real $m$:

$$f'(m) = \ln\frac{m}{10} + 1 = 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad m = \frac{10}{e} \approx 3.68 .$$

$f''(m) = 1/m > 0$, so $f$ is convex and the best integer is 3 or 4. Since $0.3^3 = 0.027$ and $0.4^4 = 0.0256$, four attempts of 2.5 minutes each are best, with the guarantee $1 - 0.0256 = 0.9744$. For comparison, $m = 2$ gives $0.96$ and $m = 5$ gives $0.9688$. By Part 3 these numbers are the exact worst case of each schedule, not only bounds. The trade-off: every additional attempt adds a factor to the product, but moves each factor $m/10$ closer to 1. The real-valued optimum has the timeout $10/m = e$ for every budget, so under this criterion an attempt is abandoned after about $e \approx 2.7$ times the mean.

### Part 5

Yes: the exponential distribution with rate 1, $S(t) = e^{-t}$, which has mean 1. Every schedule fails with probability

$$\prod_{i=1}^{m} S(t_i) = e^{-(t_1 + \dots + t_m)} = e^{-10} \approx 4.5 \times 10^{-5}.$$

This is the *memoryless property* $P(T > s + t \mid T > s) = P(T > t)$: an attempt that has already run for $s$ minutes is exactly as good as a fresh one. Conversely, if all schedules fail with the same probability, then $S(s + t) = S(s) S(t)$ whenever $s + t \le 10$, whose only non-increasing solutions are $S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}$, so within the budget the distribution has to be exponential.

### Part 6

The answer depends on how a schedule is judged.

**By the product of the Markov bounds.** Bounding each factor separately gives $\prod_i S(t_i) \le 1/(t_1 \cdots t_m)$ when all $t_i \ge 1$ (a timeout below 1 only contributes the factor 1), and by the AM–GM inequality a product with a fixed sum is largest when all factors are equal. Judged by this bound, unequal timeouts never help and Part 4 is final: $(2.5, 7.5)$ scores $1/(2.5 \cdot 7.5) \approx 0.053$, worse than the $0.04$ of $(5, 5)$.

**By the true worst case.** For unequal timeouts the product bound is not the guarantee. The factor $S(t_i)$ comes close to $1/t_i$ only if the mass $1/t_i$ sits just above $t_i$, which uses up the whole mean. All attempts draw from the same distribution, and one distribution cannot do this at two different timeouts. Think of the distribution as chosen by an *adversary* who knows the schedule.

*Two attempts.* Let the timeouts be $a \le b$ with $a + b = 10$, and write $s_1 = S(a)$, $s_2 = S(b)$, so $s_1 \ge s_2$. Since $E[T] = \int_0^\infty S(t)\;dt$ and $S$ is non-increasing,

$$1 = E[T] \ge \int_0^a S(t)\;dt + \int_a^b S(t)\;dt \ge a s_1 + (b - a) s_2 .$$

Conversely, every pair $1 \ge s_1 \ge s_2 \ge 0$ that satisfies this inequality is approached by a distribution with mean 1: mass $s_2$ just above $b$, mass $s_1 - s_2$ just above $a$, the rest at 0 (a mean below 1 is made up by an arbitrarily small mass moved far out). The adversary therefore maximises $s_1 s_2$ under these constraints. By AM–GM,

$$a s_1 \cdot (b - a) s_2 \le \left(\frac{a s_1 + (b - a) s_2}{2}\right)^{2} \le \frac{1}{4}, \qquad\text{so}\qquad s_1 s_2 \le \frac{1}{4a(b - a)} = \frac{1}{4a(10 - 2a)},$$

with equality for $s_1 = 1/(2a)$ and $s_2 = 1/(2(10 - 2a))$. This pair satisfies $s_2 \le s_1 \le 1$ exactly when $1/2 \le a \le 10/3$, and the worst-case failure probability is then $1/(4a(10 - 2a))$. It is smallest where $a(10 - 2a)$ is largest, at $a = 2.5$:

$$\text{schedule } (2.5,\; 7.5), \qquad \text{worst-case failure probability } \frac{1}{4 \cdot 2.5 \cdot 5} = \frac{1}{50}, \qquad \text{guarantee } 0.98 .$$

Outside that range a constraint is active: for $a > 10/3$ the maximum is at $s_1 = s_2 = 1/b$, with failure probability $1/(10 - a)^2 > 9/400$, and for $a < 1/2$ it is at $s_1 = 1$, with failure probability $(1 - a)/(10 - 2a) > 1/18$. Both exceed $1/50$, so $(2.5, 7.5)$ is the best schedule with two attempts. Its guarantee $0.98$ beats the $0.96$ of $(5, 5)$ and the $0.9744$ of four equal attempts. The adversary's distribution against it has mass $0.1$ just above $2.5$, mass $0.1$ just above $7.5$ and mass $0.8$ at 0.

*With $m$ attempts.* Sort the timeouts, $t_1 \le \dots \le t_m$, and let $d_i = t_i - t_{i-1}$ with $t_0 = 0$, and $s_i = S(t_i)$. The integral argument gives $\sum_i d_i s_i \le 1$ for every distribution, and the budget reads $\sum_i (m - i + 1) d_i = \sum_i t_i = 10$. Two observations settle $m \le 10$:

- With the gaps $d_i = \frac{10}{m (m - i + 1)}$, AM–GM over the $m$ terms $d_i s_i$ gives $\prod_i d_i s_i \le m^{-m}$, so $\prod_i s_i \le 1 / (m^m \prod_i d_i) = m!/10^m$ for every distribution.
- Against any schedule the adversary can put mass $1/10$ just above every timeout and the rest at 0. The mean is $\sum_i t_i / 10 = 1$ and $S(t_i) \ge (m - i + 1)/10$, so the failure probability comes arbitrarily close to a value of at least $m!/10^m$.

The best guarantee with $m \le 10$ attempts is therefore exactly $1 - m!/10^m$: $0.98$ for $m = 2$, $0.994$ for $m = 3$ with the timeouts $(10/9,\; 25/9,\; 55/9) \approx (1.11,\; 2.78,\; 6.11)$, and $0.9976$ for $m = 4$. One more attempt multiplies the failure probability by $(m + 1)/10$, so it falls until $m = 9$, where $9!/10^9 = 10!/10^{10} \approx 3.6 \times 10^{-4}$. With more than 10 attempts the adversary treats the 10 largest timeouts in the same way, so no schedule of any length has a guarantee above $1 - 9!/10^9 \approx 0.9996$.

*Known distribution.* The failure probability $\prod_i S(t_i)$ is then exact, and the *hazard rate* $h(t) = f(t)/S(t)$, with $f$ the density of $T$, decides. From $\ln S(t) = -\int_0^t h(u)\;du$, a decreasing $h$ gives $S(s + t) \ge S(s) S(t)$, so splitting an attempt lowers the failure probability. An increasing $h$ reverses the inequality and the single attempt $(10)$ is best, and a constant $h$ is the exponential distribution of Part 5.

### Follow-ups

- Known distribution, and the goal is the expected time until success, without a budget: a fixed cutoff $\tau$ gives $E = E[\min(T, \tau)] + S(\tau) E$, that is $E = E[\min(T, \tau)] / P(T \le \tau)$. The optimal strategy uses the cutoff $\tau^{\ast}$ that minimises this ratio in every attempt (Luby, Sinclair and Zuckerman).
- The same goal with an unknown distribution: using Luby's universal sequence $1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, \dots$ as cutoffs has expected time $O(T_{\mathrm{opt}} \log T_{\mathrm{opt}})$, where $T_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the expected time under $\tau^{\ast}$. No strategy that ignores the distribution is better by more than a constant factor.
- If the variance $\sigma^2$ is known as well, Cantelli's inequality $P(T \ge 1 + \lambda) \le \sigma^2 / (\sigma^2 + \lambda^2)$ replaces Markov's. With $\sigma = 1$ it gives $P(T \ge 5) \le 1/17$, attained by $T = 5$ with probability $1/17$ and $T = 0.75$ otherwise.
- If every restart costs $c$ minutes, $m$ attempts leave $10 - (m - 1)c$ minutes for the timeouts, and this number replaces 10 in all the formulas. With $c = 0.5$ the best number of attempts drops from 4 to 3 for equal timeouts and from 9 to 5 for unequal ones.
- In a real service the attempts are not independent: a request that is slow because of its own length or a loaded replica is slow again after a restart. The usual remedy is a hedged request, which sends a second copy to another replica after a delay and takes whichever answer arrives first.
