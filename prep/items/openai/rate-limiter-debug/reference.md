Run the smoke test first and confirm it is the only test given, then read `_within_window` and `should_allow_request` line by line before changing anything — every one of the four bugs is visible from the code alone, without running anything. None of the tests below waits on real time or on a lucky interleaving: `FakeClock` turns time into a number a test moves by hand, and `checkpoint` holds threads at the instant after they have decided and before they record. Both hooks make each test give the same answer on every run, which is what makes it worth keeping once the bug is fixed.

### The four bugs

Each row is one test written against the public API, so the same test can be run before and after the fix. The measured column comes from running the class exactly as given.

- Test: cap of 3 per 60 s: fill it, let the window expire, then send 10 at one instant — at most 3 may pass · The class as given: all 10 pass · Points to: bug 1, eviction
- Test: cap of 5 per day, one request a real day apart for 8 days — all 8 may pass · The class as given: 5 pass, then blocked · Points to: bug 2, the daily counter
- Test: caps of 4 per minute and 2 per hour, 4 requests at one instant — 2 may pass · The class as given: 1 passes · Points to: bug 3, the shared list
- Test: cap of 5 per minute, 20 threads all made to decide before any of them records — at most 5 may pass · The class as given: all 20 pass · Points to: bug 4, no lock

No row masks another: each test fails for its own reason. The code, though, is not as separable as the table — bugs 1 and 3 are two readings of the same two lines, and it is only because the check and the record sit in one function that the slice loses the record as well as the eviction.

**Bug 1: the slice in `_within_window`'s eviction loop.** `timestamps` starts out bound to the very list stored in `self.recent[user_id]`; slicing it, `timestamps[1:]`, builds a *new* list with the first entry gone and rebinds the local name to it, leaving `self.recent[user_id]` pointing at the original, untouched list. Two things follow. The stored list never loses an entry, however much time passes, so it only ever grows. And the `timestamps.append(now)` two lines down lands on the private copy whenever the loop ran at least once, so a rule that has expired entries to prune stops recording altogether: it keeps deciding against a copy of a stored list that no longer changes, and from the first expiry onwards it admits everything. That is the first row of the table — ten requests through a cap of three. The line that prunes has to reach the stored object; which container holds the timestamps is a separate question, and a `deque` is chosen for the cost of the eviction, not for its correctness.

```py
while window and now - window[0] > period:
    window.popleft()                   # NOTE: mutates the stored deque in place; a rebind would not
```

**Bug 2: `self.day_count[user_id] += 1` in `should_allow_request`.** Nothing ever subtracts from `day_count` or resets it, so it holds every request the user has ever had admitted: the check compares a lifetime total against a fixed cap instead of counting the requests made in the last `day_rule` seconds. A check like that can only ever go from passing to failing, never back. The user in the second row sends one request a real day apart, is never more than one deep inside the 86,400-second window, and is still blocked from the sixth request on, whatever the gap between requests. The day rule needs timestamps and a window like the other two.

```py
fits_day = self._fits(w["day"], now, *self.day_rule)  # NOTE: a window like the other two, not a total
```

**Bug 3: `self.recent[user_id]` is one list for both windowed rules, and each call to `_within_window` appends to it the moment its own rule passes.** Checking and recording one rule at a time on shared storage goes wrong twice over. A single admitted request is recorded twice — once by the minute check, once by the hour check — so both rules run out about twice as fast as their numbers promise. Worse, the minute check's append has already happened by the time the hour check reads the list; if the hour check then rejects, that append is never undone, and a request that was refused has still cost the user budget. With `minute_rule=(4, 60)` and `hour_rule=(2, 3600)` that is the third row: the first request is admitted and recorded twice, and the second — which should still fit, one real success so far against an hourly cap of 2 — is rejected by a list this same call had already pushed to length 2. Splitting the call into a decide phase and a record phase is what fixes both halves at once: per-rule storage stops one rule's record from counting against another, and recording only after all three have said yes means a rejected request leaves nothing behind.

```py
fits_minute = self._fits(w["minute"], now, *self.minute_rule)
fits_hour = self._fits(w["hour"], now, *self.hour_rule)
fits_day = self._fits(w["day"], now, *self.day_rule)  # NOTE: a window like the other two, not a total
self.checkpoint()
if not (fits_minute and fits_hour and fits_day):      # NOTE: every rule decides before any records
    return False
w["minute"].append(now)
w["hour"].append(now)
w["day"].append(now)
```

**Bug 4: nothing keeps two threads out of each other's way.** Reading `len(timestamps)`, deciding, and appending are three separate steps, so two threads can both read a count under the cap before either one appends, and both are admitted where there was room for one. Replacing `checkpoint` with a `threading.Barrier` makes that certain instead of lucky — all 20 threads finish deciding before any of them records — and all 20 are admitted against a cap of 5. One lock around the whole check-then-record is the fix, and the clock is read inside it as well: two threads reading the clock before taking the lock can record their timestamps in the wrong order, and since the eviction loop only ever looks at the head of the window, an entry that lands out of order is never removed. Concurrency cannot be argued from one run that happened to come out right, so the checks do it from both ends: with the lock taken away and the barrier in place, the over-admission is forced and the test is shown to be able to fail; with the lock back, a few hundred threads against the same cap admit exactly the cap.

```py
with self._lock:                                      # NOTE: one lock over the check and the record
    now = self.clock()                                # NOTE: read inside the lock, so the recorded
    w = self.windows[user_id]                         #       timestamps come out non-decreasing
```

With all four fixed, each rule keeps its own deque of timestamps, expiry is pruned from that deque itself, all three rules decide before any of them records, and the whole decision happens under one lock.

### Follow-ups

- `popleft()` on a `deque` is $O(1)$; the same eviction written on a plain list, `del timestamps[:i]`, costs $O(n)$ in the number of entries that survive it, because they all shift down.
- Holding the lock for all three rule checks serializes every request from every user, not just from one user; a lock per user (or per shard of users) would let unrelated users' requests through concurrently.
- `time.time` can jump backwards when the wall clock is corrected, which leaves a window's timestamps out of order exactly the way an unlocked clock read does; `time.monotonic` is the safer default for a limiter that only ever measures elapsed time.
- Nothing removes a user from `self.windows`, so it grows with the number of distinct users ever seen; an entry can be dropped once all three of that user's deques are empty, which needs a sweep or an LRU on top.
- A distributed deployment cannot keep this state in one process's memory at all: the usual fix is moving the sliding window into a store like Redis and making the check-and-record step a single atomic script, since two application servers are exactly two more threads racing the same bug.
